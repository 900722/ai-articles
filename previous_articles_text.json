        "text": "OpenAI ismaking clearthat its AI models won’t shy away from sensitive topics, and will refrain from making assertions that might “shut out some viewpoints.” In anupdated version of its Model Spec, a collection of high-level rules that indirectly govern OpenAI’s models, OpenAI says that its models “must never attempt to steer the user in pursuit of an agenda of [their] own, either directly or indirectly.” “OpenAI believes in intellectual freedom, which includes the freedom to have, hear, and discuss ideas,” the company writes in its new Model Spec. “The [model] should not avoid or censor topics in a way that, if repeated at scale, may shut out some viewpoints from public life.” The move is possibly in response to political pressure. Many of President Donald Trump’s close allies, including Elon Musk and crypto and AI “czar” David Sacks, have accused AI-powered assistants ofcensoring conservative viewpoints. Sacks hassingled outOpenAI’s ChatGPT in particular as “programmed to be woke” and untruthful about politically sensitive subjects.",

        "text": "ChatGPT, OpenAI’s text-generating AI chatbot, has taken the world by storm since its launchin November 2022.What started as a tool to supercharge productivity through writing essays and code withshort text promptshas evolved into a behemoth with300 million weekly active users. 2024 was a big year for OpenAI, from itspartnership with Applefor its generative AI offering,Apple Intelligence,the release ofGPT-4o with voice capabilities,and the highly-anticipated launch of itstext-to-video model Sora. OpenAI also faced its share of internal drama, including the notable exits of high-level execs like co-founder andlongtime chief scientist Ilya SutskeverandCTO Mira Murati.OpenAI has also been hit with lawsuits fromAlden Global Capital-owned newspapersalleging copyright infringement, as well asan injunction from Elon Muskto halt OpenAI’s transition to a for-profit. In 2025, OpenAI is battling the perception that it’s ceding ground in the AI race toChinese rivals like DeepSeek. The company has been trying to shore up itsrelationship with Washingtonas it simultaneouslypursues an ambitious data center project,and as itreportedly lays the groundworkfor one of the largest funding rounds in history. Below, you’ll find a timeline of ChatGPT product updates and releases, starting with the latest, which we’ve been updating throughout the year. If you have any other questions, check outour ChatGPT FAQ here. OpenAI has effectively canceled the release of o3 in favor of what CEO Sam Altman is calling a “simplified” product offering. In apost on X, Altman said that, in the coming months, OpenAI will release a model called GPT-5 that “integrates a lot of [OpenAI’s] technology,” including o3, in ChatGPT and its API. As a result of that roadmap decision, OpenAI no longer plans to release o3 as a standalone model. Acommonly cited statis that ChatGPT requires around 3 watt-hours of power to answer a single question. Using OpenAI’s latest default model for ChatGPT, GPT-4o, as a reference, nonprofitAI research institute Epoch AIfound the average ChatGPT queryconsumes around 0.3 watt-hours.However, the analysis doesn’t consider the additional energy costs incurred by ChatGPT with features like image generation or input processing. In response to pressure from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI is changing the way its o3-mini model communicatesits step-by-step “thought” process.ChatGPT users will see an updated “chain of thought” that shows more of the model’s “reasoning” steps and how it arrived at answers to questions. OpenAI is now allowing anyone to use ChatGPT web searchwithout having to log in.While OpenAIhad previously allowedusers to ask ChatGPT questions without signing in, responses were restricted to the chatbot’s last training update. This only applies through ChatGPT.com, however. To use ChatGPT in any form through the native mobile app, you will still need to be logged in. OpenAI announced a new AI “agent”called deep researchthat’s designed to help people conduct in-depth, complex research using ChatGPT. OpenAI says the “agent” is intended for instances where you don’t just want a quick answer or summary, but instead need to assiduously consider information from multiple websites and other sources. OpenAI used the subreddit r/ChangeMyView tomeasure the persuasive abilitiesof its AI reasoning models. OpenAI says it collects userposts from the subredditand asks its AI models to write replies, in a closed environment, that would change the Reddit user’s mind on a subject. The company then shows the responses to testers, who assess how persuasive the argument is, and finally OpenAI compares the AI models’ responses to human replies for that same post. OpenAI launched a newAI “reasoning” model, o3-mini,the newest in the company’s o family of models. OpenAI firstpreviewed the model in Decemberalongside a more capable system called o3. OpenAI is pitching its new model as both “powerful” and “affordable.” A new report from app analytics firm Appfigures found thatover half of ChatGPT’s mobile usersare under age 25, with users between ages 50 and 64 making up the second largest age demographic. The gender gap among ChatGPT users is even more significant. Appfigures estimates that across age groups, men make up 84.5% of all users. OpenAI launched ChatGPT Govdesigned to provide U.S. government agenciesan additional way to access the tech. ChatGPT Gov includes many of the capabilities found in OpenAI’s corporate-focused tier, ChatGPT Enterprise. OpenAI says that ChatGPT Gov enables agencies to more easily manage their own security, privacy, and compliance, and could expedite internal authorization of OpenAI’s tools for the handling of non-public sensitive data. Younger Gen Zers are embracing ChatGPT, for schoolwork,according to a new survey by the Pew Research Center.In a follow-up to its 2023 poll on ChatGPT usage among young people, Pew asked ~1,400 U.S.-based teens ages 13 to 17 whether they’ve used ChatGPT for homework or other school-related assignments. Twenty-six percent said that they had, double the number two years ago. Just over half of teens responding to the poll said they think it’s acceptable to use ChatGPT for researching new subjects. But considering the ways ChatGPT can fall short, the results are possibly cause for alarm. OpenAI says that it might store chats and associated screenshots from customers who use Operator,the company’s AI “agent” tool,for up to 90 days — even after a user manually deletes them. While OpenAI has a similar deleted data retention policy for ChatGPT, the retention period for ChatGPT is only 30 days,which is 60 days shorter than Operator’s. OpenAI is launching a research preview of Operator, a general-purpose AI agent that cantake control of a web browser and independently perform certain actions.Operator promises to automate tasks such as booking travel accommodations, making restaurant reservations, and shopping online. Operator,OpenAI’s agent tool,could be released sooner rather than later. Changes to ChatGPT’s code base suggest thatOperator will be available as an early research previewto users on the $200 Pro subscription plan. The changes aren’t yet publicly visible, buta user on X who goes by Choispotted these updates in ChatGPT’s client-side code. TechCrunch separately identified the same references to Operator on OpenAI’s website. OpenAI has begun testing a feature that lets new ChatGPT userssign up with only a phone number— no email required. The feature is currently in beta in the U.S. and India. However, users who create an account using their number can’t upgrade to one of OpenAI’s paid plans without verifying their account via an email. Multi-factor authentication also isn’t supported without a valid email. ChatGPT’s new beta feature, called tasks,allows users to set simple reminders. For example, you can ask ChatGPT to remind you when your passport expires in six months, and the AI assistant will follow up with a push notification on whatever platform you have tasks enabled. The feature will start rolling out to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro users around the globe this week. OpenAI is introducing a new way for users tocustomize their interactions with ChatGPT.Some users found they can specify a preferred name or nickname and “traits” they’d like the chatbot to have. OpenAI suggests traits like “Chatty,” “Encouraging,” and “Gen Z.” However,some users reportedthat the new options have disappeared, so it’s possible they went live prematurely. ChatGPT Search can be fooled into generating completely misleading summaries,The Guardian has found.They found ChatGPT could be prompted to ignore negative reviews andgenerate “entirely positive” summariesby inserting hidden text into websites it created and that ChatGPT Search could also be made to spit out malicious code using this method. Microsoft and OpenAI have a veryspecific, internal definition of AGIbased on the startup’s profits, according to a newreport from The Information.The two companies reportedly signed an agreement stating OpenAI has only achieved AGI when it develops AI systems that can generate at least $100 billion in profit, which is far from the rigorous technical and philosophical definition of AGI many would expect. OpenAIreleased new researchoutlining the company’s approach to ensure AI reasoning models stay aligned with the values of their human developers. The startup used “deliberative alignment” to make o1 and o3“think” about OpenAI’s safety policy.According to OpenAI’s research, the method decreased the rate at which o1 answered “unsafe” questions while improving its ability to answer benign ones. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announcedthe successors to its o1 reasoning model family:o3 and o3-mini. The models are not widely available yet, but safety researchers can sign up for a preview. The reveal marks the end of the “12 Days of OpenAI” event, which saw announcements for real-time vision capabilities, ChatGPT Search, and even a Santa voice for ChatGPT. In an effort to make ChatGPT accessible to as many people as possible, OpenAI announceda 1-800 number to call the chatbot— even from a landline or a flip phone. Users can call 1-800-CHATGPT, and ChatGPT will respond to your queries in an experience that is more or less identical to Advanced Voice Mode — minus the multimodality. OpenAI is offering 15 minutes of free calling for U.S. users. The company notes that standard carrier fees may apply. OpenAI is bringing ChatGPT Searchto free, logged in users.Search gives ChatGPT the ability to access real-time information on the web to better answer your queries, but was only available for paid userswhen it launched in October.Not only is Search available now for free users, but it’s also been integratedinto Advanced Voice Mode. OpenAI is blaming one of the longest outages in its history on a “new telemetry service” gone awry. OpenAI wrote in a postmortem that the outage wasn’t caused by a security incident or recent product launch, but by atelemetry service it deployedto collect Kubernetes metrics. OpenAI announced that ChatGPT users could accessa new “Santa Mode” voiceduring December. The feature allows users to speak with ChatGPT’s Advanced Voice Mode, but with a Christmas twist. The voice sounds, well, “merry and bright,” as OpenAI described it. Think boomy, jolly — more or less like every Santa you’ve ever heard. OpenAI released thereal-time video capabilities for ChatGPTthat it demoed nearly seven months ago. ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro subscribers can use the app to point their phones at objects and have ChatGPT respond in near-real-time. The feature can also understand what’s on a device’s screen through screen sharing. There’s more to come from OpenAI through December 23. Tune in toour live blogto stay updated. ChatGPT and Sora both experienced a major outage Wednesday. Though users suspected the outage was due to the rollout of ChatGPT in Apple Intelligence, OpenAI developer community lead Edwin Arbusdenied it in a post on X, saying the “outage was unrelated to 12 Days of OpenAI or Apple Intelligence. We made a config change that caused many servers to become unavailable.” ChatGPT, API, and Sora were down today but we've recovered.https://t.co/OKiQYp3tXE Canvas, OpenAI’scollaboration-focused interfacefor writing and code projects, is now rolling out to all users after being in beta for ChatGPT Plus members since October 2024. The company also announced the ability to integrate Python code within Canvas as well as bringing Canvas to custom GPTs. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman posted on X that due to higher than expected demand, they are pausing new sign-ups for its video generator Sora and that video generations will be slower for the time being. Thecompany released Soraas part of its “12 Days of OpenAI” event followingnearly a year of teasing the product. demand higher than expected; signups will be disabled on and off and generations will be slow for awhile.doing our best!https://t.co/JU3WxE5bGl OpenAI has finally released itstext to video model, Sora.The model can generate videos up to 20 seconds long in 1080p based on text prompts or uploaded images, and can be “remixed” through additional user prompts. Sora is available starting today toChatGPT Proand Plus subscribers (except in the EU). In Monday’s“12 Days of OpenAI” livestream,CEO Sam Altman said that ChatGPT Plus members will get 50 video generations a month, while ChatGPT Pro users will get “unlimited” generations in their “slow queue mode” and 500 “normal” generations per month. There are still more reveals to come from OpenAI through December 23. Tune in toour live blogto stay updated. On day one of its12 Days of OpenAI event,the company announced a new — and expensive — subscription plan. ChatGPT Pro is a$200-per-month tierthat provides unlimited access to all of OpenAI’s models, including the full version of its o1 “reasoning” model. The full version of o1, which wasreleased as a preview in September,can now reason about image uploads and has been trained to be “more concise in its thinking” to improve response times. Over the next few weeks, we’ll be updating all the news from OpenAI as it happenson our live blog.Follow along with us! OpenAI announced“12 Days of OpenAI,”which will feature livestreams every weekday starting December 5 at 10 a.m. PT. Each day’s stream is said to include either a product launch or a demo in varying sizes. 🎄🎅starting tomorrow at 10 am pacific, we are doing 12 days of openai.each weekday, we will have a livestream with a launch or demo, some big ones and some stocking stuffers.we’ve got some great stuff to share, hope you enjoy! merry christmas. At the New York Times’ Dealbook Summit, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that ChatGPT hassurpassed 300 million weekly active users.The milestone comes just a few months after the chatbothit 200 million weekly active usersin August 2024 and just over a year afterreaching 100 million weekly active usersin November 2023. ChatGPT users discovered an interesting phenomenon: the popular chatbot refused to answer questionsasked about a “David Mayer,”and asking it to do so caused it to freeze up instantly. While the strange behavior spawned conspiracy theories, and a slew of other names being impacted, a much more ordinary reason may be at the heart of it:digital privacy requests. OpenAI is toying withthe idea of getting into ads.CFO Sarah Friartold the Financial Timesit’s weighing an ads business model, with plans to be “thoughtful” about when and where ads appear — though she later stressed that the company has “no active plans to pursue advertising.” Still, the exploration may raise eyebrows given that Sam Altman recently saidads would be a “last resort.” A group of Canadian media companies, including the Toronto Star and the Globe and Mail,have filed a lawsuit against OpenAI.The companies behind the suit said that OpenAI infringed their copyrights and are seeking to win monetary damages — and ban OpenAI from making further use of their work. OpenAI announced that its GPT-4o model has been updated to feature more “natural” and “engaging” creative writing abilities as well as more thorough responses and insights when accessing files uploaded by users. GPT-4o got an update 🎉The model’s creative writing ability has leveled up–more natural, engaging, and tailored writing to improve relevance & readability.It’s also better at working with uploaded files, providing deeper insights & more thorough responses. ChatGPT’s Advanced Voice Mode featureis expanding to the web,allowing users to talk to the chatbot through their browser. The conversational feature is rolling out to ChatGPT’s paying Plus, Enterprise, Teams, or Edu subscribers. Rolling out to ChatGPT paid users this week: Advanced Voice Mode on web! 😍We launched Advanced Voice Mode in our iOS and Android apps in September, and just recently brought them to our desktop apps (https://t.co/vVRYHXsbPD)—now we’re excited to add web to the mix. This means…pic.twitter.com/HtG5Km2OGh OpenAI announced the ChatGPT desktop app for macOScan now read code in a handful of developer-focused coding apps,such as VS Code, Xcode, TextEdit, Terminal, and iTerm2 — meaning that developers will no longer have to copy and paste their code into ChatGPT. When the feature is enabled, OpenAI will automatically send the section of code you’re working on through its chatbot as context, alongside your prompt. Lilian Weng announced on X thatshe is departing OpenAI.Weng served as VP of research and safety since August, and before that was the head of OpenAI’s safety systems team. It’s the latest in a long string of AIsafety researchers,policy researchers,andother executiveswho have exited the company in the last year. After working at OpenAI for almost 7 years, I decide to leave. I learned so much and now I'm ready for a reset and something new.Here is the note I just shared with the team. 🩵pic.twitter.com/2j9K3oBhPC OpenAI stated that it told around 2 million users of ChatGPT to go elsewherefor information about the 2024 U.S. election,and instead recommended trusted news sources like Reuters and the Associated Press. In a blog post, OpenAI said that ChatGPT sent roughly a million people to CanIVote.org when they asked questions specific to voting in the lead-up to the election andrejected around 250,000 requests to generate imagesof the candidates over the same period. Adding to its collection of high-profile domain names,Chat.com now redirects to ChatGPT.Last year, it was reported that HubSpot co-founder and CTO Dharmesh Shah acquired Chat.com for $15.5 million, making it one of the top two all-time publicly reported domain sales — though OpenAI declined to state how much it paid for it. https://t.co/n494J9IuEN The former head of Meta’s augmented reality glasses effortsis joining OpenAI to lead robotics and consumer hardware.Kalinowski is a hardware executive who began leadingMeta’s AR glasses teamin March 2022. She oversaw the creation of Orion, the impressive augmented reality prototype that Meta recently showed off atits annual Connect conference. Apple is including an option to upgrade toChatGPT Plus inside its Settings app,according to an update to the iOS 18.2 betaspotted by 9to5Mac.This will give Apple users a direct route to sign up for OpenAI’s premium subscription plan, which costs $20 a month. Ina Reddit AMA,OpenAI CEO Sam Altman admitted that a lack of compute capacity is one major factor preventing the company from shipping products as often as it’d like, including the vision capabilities for Advanced Voice Modefirst teased in May.Altman also indicated that the next major release of DALL-E, OpenAI’s image generator, has no launch timeline, and thatSora, OpenAI’s video-generating tool,has also been held back. Altman also admitted tousing ChatGPT “sometimes”to answer questions throughout the AMA. OpenAIlaunched ChatGPT Search,an evolution of theSearchGPT prototypeit unveiled this summer. Powered by a fine-tuned version of OpenAI’s GPT-4o model, ChatGPT Search serves up information and photos from the web along with links to relevant sources, at which point you can ask follow-up questions to refine an ongoing search. 🌐 Introducing ChatGPT search 🌐ChatGPT can now search the web in a much better way than before so you get fast, timely answers with links to relevant web sources.https://t.co/7yilNgqH9Tpic.twitter.com/z8mJWS8J9c OpenAI has rolled out Advanced Voice Mode to ChatGPT’s desktop apps for macOS and Windows.

It appears, at least for now, the company has abandoned plans to establish a network of factories for chip manufacturing and is instead focusing on in-house chip design. OpenAI announced it’s rolling out a feature that allows users to search through their ChatGPT chat histories on the web. The new feature will let users bring up an old chat to remember something or pick back up a chat right where it was left off. We’re starting to roll out the ability to search through your chat history on ChatGPT web.Now you can quickly & easily bring up a chat to reference, or pick up a chat where you left off.pic.twitter.com/YVAOUpFvzJ With therelease of iOS 18.1,Apple Intelligence features powered by ChatGPTare now available to users.The ChatGPT features include integrated writing tools, image cleanup, article summaries, and a typing input for the redesigned Siri experience. OpenAI denied reports that it is intending to release anAI model, code-named Orion,by December of this year. An OpenAI spokesperson told TechCrunch that they “don’t have plans to release a model code-named Orion this year,” but that leaves OpenAI substantial wiggle room. OpenAI has begun previewinga dedicated Windows app for ChatGPT.The company says the app is an early version and is currently only available to ChatGPT Plus, Team, Enterprise, and Edu users with a “full experience” set to come later this year. OpenAI struck acontent deal with Hearst,the newspaper and magazine publisher known for the San Francisco Chronicle, Esquire, Cosmopolitan, ELLE, and others. The partnership will allow OpenAI to surface stories from Hearst publications with citations and direct links. OpenAI introduced a new way tointeract with ChatGPT called “Canvas.”The canvas workspace allows for users to generate writing or code, then highlight sections of the work to have the model edit. Canvas is rolling out in beta to ChatGPT Plus and Teams, with a rollout to come to Enterprise and Edu tier users next week. When writing code, canvas makes it easier to track and understand ChatGPT’s changes.It can also review code, add logs and comments, fix bugs, and port to other coding languages like JavaScript and Python.pic.twitter.com/Fxssd5pDl0 OpenAI hasclosed the largest VC round of all time.The startup announced it raised $6.6 billion in a funding round that values OpenAI at $157 billion post-money. Led by previous investor Thrive Capital, the new cash brings OpenAI’s total raised to $17.9 billion, per Crunchbase. At the first of its 2024 Dev Day events, OpenAIannounced a new API toolthat will let developers build nearly real-time, speech-to-speech experiences in their apps, with the choice of using six voices provided by OpenAI. These voices are distinct from those offered for ChatGPT, and developers can’t use third party voices, in order to prevent copyright issues. OpenAI is planning toraise the price of individual ChatGPT subscriptionsfrom $20 per month to $22 per month by the end of the year, according to a report from The New York Times. The report notes that a steeper increase could come over the next five years; by 2029, OpenAI expects it’ll charge $44 per month for ChatGPT Plus. OpenAI CTO Mira Murati announcedthat she is leaving the companyafter more than six years. Hours after the announcement, OpenAI’s chief research officer, Bob McGrew, and a research VP, Barret Zoph,also left the company.CEO Sam Altman revealed the two latest resignations in a post on X, along with leadership transition plans. i just posted this note to openai:Hi All–Mira has been instrumental to OpenAI’s progress and growth the last 6.5 years; she has been a hugely significant factor in our development from an unknown research lab to an important company.When Mira informed me this morning that… After a delay, OpenAI is finallyrolling out Advanced Voice Modeto an expanded set of ChatGPT’s paying customers. AVM is also getting a revamped design — the feature is now represented by a blue animated sphere instead of the animated black dots that were presented back in May. OpenAI is highlighting improvements in conversational speed, accents in foreign languages, and five new voices as part of the rollout. OpenAI is rolling out Advanced Voice Mode (AVM), an audio feature that makes ChatGPT more natural to speak with and includes five new voicespic.twitter.com/y97BCoob5b A video from YouTube creator ChromaLock showcased how to modify a TI-84 graphing calculator so that it can connect to the internetand access ChatGPT, touting it as the “ultimate cheating device.” As demonstrated in the video, it’s a pretty complicated process for the average high school student to follow — but it might stoke more concerns from teachers about the ongoing concerns about ChatGPT and cheating in schools. OpenAIunveiled a preview of OpenAI o1, also known as “Strawberry.” The collection of models are available in ChatGPT and via OpenAI’s API: o1-preview and o1 mini. The company claims that o1 can more effectively reason through math and science and fact-check itself by spending more time considering all parts of a command or question. Unlike ChatGPT, o1 can’t browse the web or analyze files yet, is rate-limited and expensive compared to other models. OpenAI says it plans to bring o1-mini access to all free users of ChatGPT, but hasn’t set a release date. OpenAI o1 codes a video game from a prompt.pic.twitter.com/aBEcehP0j8 An artist and hacker founda way to jailbreak ChatGPTto produce instructions for making powerful explosives, a request that the chatbot normally refuses. An explosives expert who reviewed the chatbot’s output told TechCrunch that the instructions could be used to make a detonatable product and was too sensitive to be released. OpenAI announced ithas surpassed 1 million paid usersfor its versions of ChatGPT intended for businesses, including ChatGPT Team, ChatGPT Enterprise and its educational offering, ChatGPT Edu. The company said that nearly half of OpenAI’s corporate users are based in the US. Volkswagen is taking itsChatGPT voice assistant experimentto vehicles in the United States. Its ChatGPT-integrated Plus Speech voice assistant is an AI chatbot based on Cerence’s Chat Pro product and a LLM from OpenAI and will begin rolling out on September 6 with the 2025 Jetta and Jetta GLI models. As part of the new deal,OpenAI will surface stories from Condé Nast propertieslike The New Yorker, Vogue, Vanity Fair, Bon Appétit and Wired in ChatGPT and SearchGPT. Condé Nast CEO Roger Lynch implied that the “multi-year” deal will involve payment from OpenAI in some form and a Condé Nast spokesperson told TechCrunch that OpenAI will have permission to train on Condé Nast content. We’re partnering with Condé Nast to deepen the integration of quality journalism into ChatGPT and our SearchGPT prototype.https://t.co/tiXqSOTNAl TechCrunch’s Maxwell Zeff has beenplaying around with OpenAI’s Advanced Voice Mode,in what he describes as “the most convincing taste I’ve had of an AI-powered future yet.” Compared to Siri or Alexa, Advanced Voice Mode stands out with faster response times, unique answers and the ability to answer complex questions. But the feature falls short as an effective replacement for virtual assistants. OpenAI has banned a cluster of ChatGPT accountslinked to an Iranian influence operationthat was generating content about the U.S. presidential election.OpenAI identified five website frontspresenting as both progressive and conservative news outlets that used ChatGPT to draft several long-form articles, though it doesn’t seem that it reached much of an audience. OpenAI has found that GPT-4o, which powers the recently launched alpha ofAdvanced Voice Modein ChatGPT, can behave in strange ways. In a new “red teaming” report, OpenAI reveals some ofGPT-4o’s weirder quirks,like mimicking the voice of the person speaking to it or randomly shouting in the middle of a conversation. After a big jump following the release of OpenAI’snew GPT-4o “omni” model,the mobile version of ChatGPT has now seenits biggest month of revenue yet.The app pulled in $28 million in net revenue from the App Store and Google Play in July, according to data provided by app intelligence firm Appfigures. OpenAI has built a watermarking tool that could potentially catch students who cheat by using ChatGPT — butThe Wall Street Journal reportsthat the company is debating whether to actually release it. An OpenAI spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch that the company is researching tools that can detect writing from ChatGPT, but said it’s takinga “deliberate approach” to releasing it. OpenAI is giving users their first access toGPT-4o’s updated realistic audio responses.The alpha version is now available to a small group of ChatGPT Plus users, and the company says the feature will gradually roll out to all Plus users in the fall of 2024. The release follows controversy surrounding thevoice’s similarity to Scarlett Johansson,leading OpenAI to delay its release.

The company will become OpenAI’s biggest customer to date, covering 100,000 users, and will become OpenAI’s first partner for selling its enterprise offerings to other businesses. OpenAI announced in a blog post that it hasrecently begun training its next flagship modelto succeed GPT-4. The news came in an announcement of its new safety and security committee, which is responsible for informing safety and security decisions across OpenAI’s products. On the The TED AI Show podcast, former OpenAI board member Helen Toner revealed that the board did not know about ChatGPTuntil its launch in November 2022.Toner also said that Sam Altman gave the board inaccurate information about the safety processes the company had in place and that he didn’t disclose his involvement in the OpenAI Startup Fund. Sharing this, recorded a few weeks ago. Most of the episode is about AI policy more broadly, but this was my first longform interview since the OpenAI investigation closed, so we also talked a bit about November.Thanks to@bilawalsidhufor a fun conversation!https://t.co/h0PtK06T0K The launch of GPT-4o has driven the company’sbiggest-ever spike in revenue on mobile, despite the model being freely available on the web. Mobile users are being pushed to upgrade to its $19.99 monthly subscription, ChatGPT Plus, if they want to experiment with OpenAI’s most recent launch. After demoing its new GPT-4o model last week,OpenAI announced it is pausing one of its voices, Sky, after users found that it sounded similar to Scarlett Johansson in “Her.” OpenAI explainedin a blog postthat Sky’s voice is “not an imitation” of the actress and that AI voices should not intentionally mimic the voice of a celebrity. The blog post went on to explain how the company chose its voices: Breeze, Cove, Ember, Juniper and Sky. We’ve heard questions about how we chose the voices in ChatGPT, especially Sky. We are working to pause the use of Sky while we address them.Read more about how we chose these voices:https://t.co/R8wwZjU36L OpenAI announcednew updates for easier data analysis within ChatGPT.

OpenAI demos real-time language translation with its latest GPT-4o model.pic.twitter.com/pXtHQ9mKGc The company announced it’s building a tool, Media Manager, that willallow creators to better control how their content is being usedto train generative AI models — and give them an option to opt out. The goal is to have the new toolin place and ready to use by 2025. In a newpeek behind the curtain of its AI’s secret instructions, OpenAI also releaseda new NSFW policy. Though it’s intended to start a conversation about how it might allow explicit images and text in its AI products, it raises questions about whether OpenAI — or any generative AI vendor — can be trusted to handle sensitive content ethically. In a new partnership,OpenAI will get access to developer platform Stack Overflow’s APIand will get feedback from developers to improve the performance of their AI models. In return, OpenAI will include attributions to Stack Overflow in ChatGPT. However, the deal was not favorable to some Stack Overflow users —leading to some sabotaging their answer in protest. Alden Global Capital-owned newspapers, including the New York Daily News, the Chicago Tribune, and the Denver Post,are suing OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright infringement.The lawsuit alleges that the companies stole millions of copyrighted articles “without permission and without payment” to bolster ChatGPT and Copilot. OpenAI has partnered with another news publisher in Europe,London’s Financial Times, that the company will be paying for content access. “Through the partnership, ChatGPT users will be able to see select attributed summaries, quotes and rich links to FT journalism in response to relevant queries,”the FT wrote in a press release. OpenAI isopening a new office in Tokyoand has plans for a GPT-4 model optimized specifically for the Japanese language. The move underscores how OpenAI will likely need to localize its technology to different languages as it expands. According to Reuters, OpenAI’sSam Altman hosted hundreds of executivesfrom Fortune 500 companies across several cities in April, pitching versions of its AI services intended for corporate use. Premium ChatGPT users — customers paying for ChatGPT Plus, Team or Enterprise — can now usean updated and enhanced version of GPT-4 Turbo. The new model brings with it improvements in writing, math, logical reasoning and coding, OpenAI claims, as well as a more up-to-date knowledge base. Our new GPT-4 Turbo is now available to paid ChatGPT users. We’ve improved capabilities in writing, math, logical reasoning, and coding.Source:https://t.co/fjoXDCOnPrpic.twitter.com/I4fg4aDq1T You can now use ChatGPTwithout signing up for an account, but it won’t be quite the same experience. You won’t be able to save or share chats, use custom instructions, or other features associated with a persistent account. This version of ChatGPT will have “slightly more restrictive content policies,” according to OpenAI. When TechCrunch asked for more details, however, the response was unclear: “The signed out experience will benefit from the existing safety mitigations that are already built into the model, such as refusing to generate harmful content. In addition to these existing mitigations, we are also implementing additional safeguards specifically designed to address other forms of content that may be inappropriate for a signed out experience,” a spokesperson said. TechCrunch found that the OpenAI’s GPT Storeis flooded with bizarre, potentially copyright-infringing GPTs. A cursory search pulls up GPTs that claim to generate art in the style of Disney and Marvel properties, but serve as little more than funnels to third-party paid services and advertise themselves as being able to bypass AI content detection tools. In acourt filing opposing OpenAI’s motion to dismiss The New York Times’ lawsuitalleging copyright infringement, the newspaper asserted that “OpenAI’s attention-grabbing claim that The Times ‘hacked’ its products is as irrelevant as it is false.” The New York Times also claimed that some users of ChatGPT used the tool to bypass its paywalls. At a SXSW 2024 panel, Peter Deng, OpenAI’s VP of consumer product dodged a question on whetherartists whose work was used to train generative AI models should be compensated. While OpenAI lets artists “opt out” of and remove their work from the datasets that the company uses to train its image-generating models, some artists have described the tool as onerous. ChatGPT’s environmental impact appears to be massive. According to areport from The New Yorker, ChatGPT uses an estimated 17,000 times the amount of electricity than the average U.S. household to respond to roughly 200 million requests each day. OpenAI released a newRead Aloud featurefor the web version of ChatGPT as well as the iOS and Android apps. The feature allows ChatGPT to read its responses to queries in one of five voice options and can speak 37 languages, according to the company. Read aloud is available on both GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 models. ChatGPT can now read responses to you. On iOS or Android, tap and hold the message and then tap “Read Aloud”. We’ve also started rolling on web – click the \"Read Aloud\" button below the message.pic.twitter.com/KevIkgAFbG — OpenAI (@OpenAI)March 4, 2024  As part of a new partnership with OpenAI,the Dublin City Council will use GPT-4to craft personalized itineraries for travelers, including recommendations of unique and cultural destinations, in an effort to support tourism across Europe. New York-based law firm Cuddy Law was criticized by a judge forusing ChatGPT to calculate their hourly billing rate. The firm submitted a $113,500 bill to the court, which was then halved by District Judge Paul Engelmayer, who called the figure “well above” reasonable demands. ChatGPT users found that ChatGPT was givingnonsensical answers for several hours, prompting OpenAI to investigate the issue. Incidents varied from repetitive phrases to confusing and incorrect answers to queries. The issue was resolved by OpenAI the following morning. The dating app giant home to Tinder, Match and OkCupid announced an enterprise agreement with OpenAIin an enthusiastic press release written with the help of ChatGPT. The AI tech willbe used to help employees with work-related tasksand come as part of Match’s $20 million-plus bet on AI in 2024. As part of a test,OpenAI began rolling out new “memory” controlsfor a small portion of ChatGPT free and paid users, with a broader rollout to follow. The controls let you tell ChatGPT explicitly to remember something, see what it remembers or turn off its memory altogether. Note that deleting a chat from chat history won’t erase ChatGPT’s or a custom GPT’s memories — you must delete the memory itself. We’re testing ChatGPT's ability to remember things you discuss to make future chats more helpful. This feature is being rolled out to a small portion of Free and Plus users, and it's easy to turn on or off.https://t.co/1Tv355oa7Vpic.twitter.com/BsFinBSTbs — OpenAI (@OpenAI)February 13, 2024  Initially limited to a small subset of free and subscription users, Temporary Chat lets you have a dialogue with a blank slate. With Temporary Chat, ChatGPT won’t be aware of previous conversations or access memories but will follow custom instructions if they’re enabled. But, OpenAI says it may keep a copy of Temporary Chat conversations for up to 30 days for “safety reasons.” Use temporary chat for conversations in which you don’t want to use memory or appear in history.pic.twitter.com/H1U82zoXyC — OpenAI (@OpenAI)February 13, 2024  Paid users of ChatGPT cannow bring GPTs into a conversationby typing “@” and selecting a GPT from the list. The chosen GPT will have an understanding of the full conversation, and different GPTs can be “tagged in” for different use cases and needs. You can now bring GPTs into any conversation in ChatGPT – simply type @ and select the GPT. This allows you to add relevant GPTs with the full context of the conversation.pic.twitter.com/Pjn5uIy9NF — OpenAI (@OpenAI)January 30, 2024  Screenshots provided to Ars Technica found thatChatGPT is potentially leaking unpublished research papers, login credentials and private informationfrom its users. An OpenAI representative told Ars Technica that the company was investigating the report. OpenAI has been toldit’s suspected of violating European Union privacy, following a multi-month investigation of ChatGPT by Italy’s data protection authority. Details of the draft findings haven’t been disclosed, but in a response, OpenAI said: “We want our AI to learn about the world, not about private individuals.” In an effort to win the trust of parents and policymakers,OpenAI announced it’s partnering with Common Sense Mediato collaborate on AI guidelines and education materials for parents, educators and young adults. The organization works to identify and minimize tech harms to young people and previously flagged ChatGPT aslacking in transparency and privacy. Aftera letter from the Congressional Black Caucusquestioned the lack of diversity in OpenAI’s board, the companyresponded. The response, signed by CEO Sam Altman and Chairman of the Board Bret Taylor, said building a complete and diverse board was one of the company’s top priorities and that it was working with an executive search firm to assist it in finding talent. Ina blog post, OpenAI announced price drops for GPT-3.5’s API, with input prices dropping to 50% and output by 25%, to $0.0005 per thousand tokens in, and $0.0015 per thousand tokens out. GPT-4 Turbo also got a new preview model for API use, which includes an interesting fix thataims to reduce “laziness”that users have experienced.

Dean Phillips (D-Minn.)to help bolster his presidential campaign. The ban comes just weeks after OpenAI published a plan to combat election misinformation, which listed “chatbots impersonating candidates” as against its policy. Beginning in February,Arizona State University will have full access to ChatGPT’s Enterprise tier, which the university plans to use to build a personalized AI tutor, develop AI avatars, bolster their prompt engineering course and more. It marks OpenAI’s first partnership with a higher education institution. After receiving the prestigious Akutagawa Prize for her novel The Tokyo Tower of Sympathy, author Rie Kudanadmitted that around 5% of the book quoted ChatGPT-generated sentences“verbatim.”Interestingly enough, the novel revolves around a futuristic world with a pervasive presence of AI. In a conversation with Bill Gates on theUnconfuse Mepodcast, Sam Altman confirmed an upcoming release of GPT-5 that will be “fully multimodal with speech, image, code, and video support.” Altman said users can expect to see GPT-5 drop sometime in 2024. OpenAI is forming aCollective Alignment teamof researchers and engineers to create a system for collecting and “encoding” public input on its models’ behaviors into OpenAI products and services. This comes as a part of OpenAI’s public program to award grants to fund experiments in setting up a “democratic process” for determining the rules AI systems follow. In a blog post, OpenAI announcedusers will not be allowed to build applications for political campaigning and lobbying until the company works out how effective their tools are for “personalized persuasion.” Users will also be banned from creating chatbots that impersonate candidates or government institutions, and from using OpenAI tools to misrepresent the voting process or otherwise discourage voting. The company is also testing out a tool that detects DALL-E generated images and will incorporate access to real-time news, with attribution, in ChatGPT.

In addition to gaining access to GPT-4, GPT-4 with Vision and DALL-E3, ChatGPT Team lets teams build and share GPTs for their business needs. After some back and forth over the last few months,OpenAI’s GPT Store is finally here. The feature lives in a new tab in the ChatGPT web client, and includes a range of GPTs developed both by OpenAI’s partners and the wider dev community.

OpenAI argued that it would be “impossible” to train AI models without using copyrighted materials, and that they believe copyright law “does not forbid training.” OpenAI published a public responseto The New York Times’s lawsuit against them and Microsoft for allegedly violating copyright law, claiming that the case is without merit. In the response, OpenAI reiterates its view that training AI models using publicly available data from the web is fair use. It also makes the case that regurgitation is less likely to occur with training data from a single source and places the onus on users to “act responsibly.” We build AI to empower people, including journalists. Our position on the@nytimeslawsuit:• Training is fair use, but we provide an opt-out• \"Regurgitation\" is a rare bug we're driving to zero• The New York Times is not telling the full storyhttps://t.co/S6fSaDsfKb — OpenAI (@OpenAI)January 8, 2024  After beingdelayed in December,OpenAI plans to launch its GPT Storesometime in the coming week, according to an email viewed by TechCrunch. OpenAI says developers building GPTs will have to review the company’s updated usage policies and GPT brand guidelines to ensure their GPTs are compliant before they’re eligible for listing in the GPT Store. OpenAI’s update notably didn’t include any information on the expected monetization opportunities for developers listing their apps on the storefront.

The move appears to be intended to shrink its regulatory risk in the European Union, where the company has been under scrutiny over ChatGPT’s impact on people’s privacy. ChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startupOpenAI. The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text. November 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use. Both the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model isGPT-4o. There is a free version ofChatGPTthat only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version,ChatGPT Plus. Anyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies andsearch enginesare utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns. Multiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others maylimit the use of the AI-powered tool. Most recently,Microsoft announcedat its 2023 Build conference that it is integrating it ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startupLooking Glass utilizes ChatGPTto produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT.  And nonprofit organizationSolana officially integrated the chatbotinto its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space. GPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer. A chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn’t necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they’ll give canned responses to questions. ChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt. Yes. Due to the nature of how these models work, they don’t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That’s a problem when you’re using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn’t commit, that may well at this point be libel. We will see howhandling troubling statements produced by ChatGPTwill play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry. Yes,there is a free ChatGPT mobile appfor iOS and Android users. It’s not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words. Yes, it wasreleasedMarch 1, 2023. Everyday examples include programming, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc. Advanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc. It depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can’t necessarily program an entire app’s worth of code. That’s because ChatGPT lacks context awareness — in other words, the generated code isn’t always appropriate for the specific context in which it’s being used. Yes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet. Yes. There aremultiple AI-powered chatbotcompetitors such asTogether, Google’sGeminiand Anthropic’sClaude, and developers arecreating open sourcealternatives. OpenAI has said that individuals in “certain jurisdictions” (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling outthis form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression “in accordance with applicable laws”. The web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled “OpenAI Personal Data Removal Request”. In its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on “legitimate interest” (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out — when it writes: “Seeherefor instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.” Recently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI’s technology into its bot named Clyde wheretwo users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine(meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm. An Australian mayor has publicly announcedhe may sue OpenAI for defamationdue to ChatGPT’s false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service. CNET found itself in the midst of controversy afterFuturism reportedthe publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, wasaccusedof using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect. Several major school systems and colleges,including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim thatnot every educator agrees with. There have also been cases of ChatGPTaccusing individuals of false crimes. Several marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One isPromptBase. Another isChatX. More launch every day. Poorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in ourtests, they’re inconsistent at best. No. But OpenAIrecentlydisclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users’ conversations to other people on the service. None specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI isinvolvedin at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT. Yes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data.",

        "link": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/12/openai-cancels-its-o3-ai-model-in-favor-of-a-unified-next-gen-release/",
        "text": "OpenAI has effectively canceled the release ofo3, which was slated to be the company’s next major AI model, in favor of what CEO Sam Altman is calling a “simplified” product offering. In apost on X on Wednesday, Altman said that in the coming months, OpenAI will release a model called GPT-5 that “integrates a lot of [OpenAI’s] technology,” including o3, in its AI-powered chatbot platformChatGPTand API. As a result of that roadmap decision, OpenAI no longer plans to launch o3 as a stand-alone model. The company originally said in December that it aimed to release o3 sometime early this year. Just a few weeks ago, Kevin Weil, OpenAI’s chief product officer,said in an interviewthat o3 was on track for a “February-March” launch. “We want to do a better job of sharing our intended roadmap, and a much better job simplifying our product offerings,” Altman wrote in his post. “We want AI to ‘just work’ for you; we realize how complicated our model and product offerings have gotten. We hate the model picker [in ChatGPT] as much as you do and want to return to magic unified intelligence.” Altman also announced that OpenAI plans to offer unlimited chat access to GPT-5 at the “standard intelligence setting,” subject to “abuse thresholds,” once the model is generally available. (Altman declined to provide more detail on what this setting — and these abuse thresholds — entail.) Subscribers to ChatGPT Plus will be able to run GPT-5 at a “higher level of intelligence,” Altman said, while ChatGPT Pro subscribers will be able to run GPT-5 at an “even higher level of intelligence.” “[GPT-5] will incorporate voice, canvas, search, deep research, and more,” he added, referring to a range of features OpenAI has launched in ChatGPT over the past few months. “[A] top goal for us is to unify [our] models by creating systems that can use all our tools, know when to think for a long time or not, and generally be useful for a very wide range of tasks.” Before GPT-5 rolls out, OpenAI plans to release GPT-4.5, a model code-named “Orion,” in the next several weeks, according to Altman. Altman says this will be the company’s last “non-chain-of-thought model.” Unlike o3 and OpenAI’s other “reasoning” models, non-chain-of-thought models tend to be less reliable in domains like math and physics. It seems that OpenAI is fully embracing the reasoning model trend it arguably kickstarted with its first reasoning model,o1, late last year. Reasoning models effectively fact-check themselves, whichhelps them to avoid some of the pitfalls that normally trip up models. This fact-checking process incurs some latency — reasoning models take a little longer, usually seconds to minutes longer, to arrive at solutions. But they tend to be both more reliable and capable. Chinese AI lab DeepSeek captured the world’s attention recently with its R1 model, which matched o1 on a number of benchmarks. As opposed to o1, R1 is an “open” model under a permissive license, meaning it can be downloaded and used as developers see fit. In recent social media posts, Altmanadmittedthat DeepSeek has lessened OpenAI’s technological lead in AI, andsaidthat OpenAI would “pull up some releases” to better compete. GPT-4.5, or Orion, is said to have suffered a number of performance-related challenges and technical setbacks.Bloomberg,The Information, andThe Wall Street Journalhave independently reported that Orion has shown less of an improvement over its predecessor,GPT-4o, than GPT-4 did over GPT-3.",

        "title": "Apple is reportedly exploring humanoid robots",
        "link": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/12/apple-is-reportedly-exploring-humanoid-robots/",
        "text": "Apple is exploring both humanoid and non-humanoid robotic form factors, according toa new scoopfrom longtime Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. The intel comes on the heels ofa research paperfrom the iPhone maker that explores human interactions with “non-anthropomorphic” robots — specifically a Pixar-style lamp. While Apple’s research paper highlights elements that could inform an eventual consumer robot, the work primarily shines a light on progress from a company still mired in the early research stages of a complex field. Kuo qualifies the work as “early proof-of-concept,” adding that the Apple Car project waseffectively abandonedin a similarly early stage. Citing “current progress and typical development cycles,” Kuo projects 2028 as an optimistic timeline for mass production. What makes robots unique compared to other early-stage Apple projects — such as a rumoredfoldable iPhone— is the level of transparency from the notoriously tight-lipped Apple. (This is the same company that, as part of a legal settlement, recently demanded a public apology from a former iOS engineerwho leaked detailsabout the Vision Pro.) It’s unavoidable. Progress in robotics is supported by work from universities and research facilities, along with behind-the-scenes corporate projects. For the past several years, many robotics companies have faced difficulties hiring quickly enough to support release timelines that have accelerated in the age of generative AI. Publishing research for the public to read is a great resource for recruiting engineers. Kuo suggests that the research paper’s use of the “non-anthropomorphic” qualifier is designed to distinguish the robot from humanoid research. “While the industry debates the merits of humanoid vs. non-humanoid designs,” he writes, “supply chain checks indicate Apple cares more about how users build perception with robots than their physical appearance … implying sensing hardware and software serve as the core technologies.” Broadly speaking, “anthropomorphic” can be applied to robotic systems beyond what we might normally classify as a humanoid. This includes systems that are influenced by human characteristics but aren’t exactly a one-to-one humanoid with two arms, two legs, and a face. Apple appears to currently be in the “throw it at the wall” phase, with work ranging from simple systems to complex humanoids. Kuo broadly refers to the proof-of-concept system as part of a “future smart home ecosystem.” That could mean anything from a full humanoid designed for household chores toa smart home display with a mechanical arm. Leaks around the work have suggested the latter — which is far more plausible than coming out of the gate with a humanoid capable of folding your laundry. Such a product could have a place on a far-off road map, but to get there, Apple first needs to prove that people want a home robot that isn’t just a vacuum. Numerous companies that are building industrial humanoids, including 1X, Figure, and Apptronik, are researching a path from the factory floor to the home. Pricing and reliability are two major sticking points. If you think the $3,499 Vision Pro was a tough pill to swallow, wait until you see the first batch of humanoids for the home. For now, the goal is getting reliable industrial humanoid production to scale, which will bring the price down over time. After abandoning the Apple Car and stumbling out the gate with both the Vision Pro and Apple Intelligence, it’s fair to assume that Apple is taking a cautious approach to robots. While Apple has a solid track record of popularizing existing product categories, Silicon Valley is littered with the husks of failed home robots. The same can also be said for the smart home category. One thing we can say for certain is that Apple is actively exploring robotics. Beyond that, we can probably look forward to at least another three years of leaks and speculation. ",

        "link": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/12/this-week-in-ai-musk-bids-for-openai/",
        "text": "Hiya, folks, welcome to TechCrunch’s regular AI newsletter. If you want this in your inbox every Wednesday, sign uphere. The billionaires are fighting again. On Monday, Elon Musk, the world’s richest man,offered to buy the nonprofitthat effectively governs OpenAI for $97.4 billion. In response to Musk’s offer, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman earlier Monday authoreda cheeky post on X, writing, “No thank you, but we will buy Twitter for $9.74 billion if you want.” (Musk and investors famouslypurchased Twitter for $44 billionin 2022.) Musk’s bid, serious or not, may complicate OpenAI’s effort to convert to a for-profit public benefit corporation within two years. Now OpenAI’s board will have to demonstrate it’s not underselling OpenAI’s nonprofit by handing the nonprofit’s assets, including IP from OpenAI’s research, to an insider (e.g., Altman) for a discount. OpenAI could make the case that Musk’s bid is a hostile takeover attempt given that Musk and Altmanaren’t the best of friends. It could also argue that Musk’s offer isn’t credible because OpenAI is already in the midst of a restructuring process. Or OpenAI couldchallenge Musk on whether he has the funds. In astatement Tuesday, Andy Nussbaum, outside counsel representing OpenAI’s board, said that Musk’s bid “doesn’t set a value for [OpenAI’s] nonprofit” and that the nonprofit is “not for sale.” Nussbaum added, “Respectfully, it is not up to a competitor to decide what is in the best interests of OpenAI’s mission.”My colleague Maxwell Zeff and Iwrote a more detailed pieceon what to expect in the coming weeks. But guaranteed, Musk’s offer — not to mention hisongoing lawsuit against OpenAI over what he claims is fraudulent conduct— promises to make for fierce courtroom brawls. Apple’s new robot:Apple created a research robot that takes a page from Pixar’s playbook. The company’s robotic lamp operates as a more kinetic version of a HomePod or other smart speaker. The person facing the lamp asks a query, and the robot responds in Siri’s voice. Is AI making us dumb?:Researchers recently published a study looking at how using generative AI at work affects critical thinking skills. It found that when we rely too much on AI to think for us, we get worse at solving problems ourselves when AI fails. AI for all, perhaps:In a new essay on his personal blog, Altman admitted that AI’s benefits may not be widely distributed — and said that OpenAI is open to “strange-sounding” ideas like a “compute budget” to “enable everyone on Earth to use a lot of AI.” Christie’s controversy:Fine art auction house Christie’s has sold AI-generated art before. But soon it plans to hold its first show dedicated solely to works created with AI, an announcement that has been met with mixed reviews — and a petition calling for the auction’s cancellation. Better than gold:An AI system developed by Google DeepMind, Google’s leading AI research lab, appears to have surpassed the average gold medalist in solving geometry problems in an international mathematics competition. We know that most AI models can’t perform basic tasks reliably, like solving grade-school-level math problems. What we don’t always know isthe reasonbehind their failures. According to a team of researchers at MIT CSAIL, erroneous benchmarks may be in part to blame. In a new study, the MIT CSAIL researchers found that while today’s top-performing models still make genuine mistakes on popular AI benchmarks, over 50% of “model errors” are actually caused by mislabeled and ambiguous questions in those benchmarks. “If we want to properly quantify model reliability, we need to rethink how we construct benchmarks to minimize label errors,” saidone of the researchers, MIT faculty member and OpenAI staffer Aleksander Madry,in a post on X. “This is just a first step.” You’ve heard of deepfakes before. But what about deepfakes of boring everyday scenes? That’s the idea behindBoring Reality Hunyuan LoRA (Boreal-HL), a fine-tuned AI video generator that excels at creating videos of … well, pretty banal stuff. Boreal-HL can generate clips of tourists eating ice cream, people barbecuing meat, people in lunch meetings, executives giving speeches at conferences, couples at weddings, and other mundane slices of life. This reporter finds the absurdity of the thing hilarious — particularly considering how impractical it is to run. It takes Boreal-HL at least five minutes to generate a single clip. Thanks to recent breakthroughs in AI efficiency, it’s getting cheaper — and easier — to train highly sophisticated  models. In a new paper, researchers at Shanghai Jiao Tong University and an AI company called SII demonstrate that a model trained on just 817 “curated training samples” can outperform models trained on 100x more data. The team claims that their model was even able to answer certain questions it hadn’t seen during the training process, showing what they call “out of domain” capabilities. The study follows on the heels of aStanford-led projectthat found it’s possible to create an “open” model rivaling OpenAI’s o1 “reasoning” model for under $50.",

        "text": "Drata, a security compliance automation platform that helps companies adhere to frameworks such as SOC 2 and GDPR, hasacquiredsoftware security review startup SafeBasefor $250 million. SafeBase co-founders Al Yang (CEO) and Adar Arnon (CTO) will retain their roles, and SafeBase will continue to offer a stand-alone product while bringing its core solutions to Drata’s platform. “This partnership isn’t just about combining complementary products,” Yangwrote in a post on SafeBase’s official blog Tuesday. “It’s a union of two customer-obsessed companies with aligned missions and cultures, focused on delivering the tools enterprises need to succeed.” Yang and Arnon founded SafeBase in 2020 after meeting at Harvard Business School. Incubated by Y Combinator, the company helps customers fill out security questionnaires — the reviews that organizations normally kick off before purchasing a new piece of software. SafeBase employs AI models specifically trained on security documentation use cases to read and interpret security information and questions, and then automatically respond to security questionnaires. Beyond the custom models, SafeBase provides an engine that allows a company to assign rules-based behavior for customer access, as well as dashboards that show insights and analytics on the company’s security posture. SafeBase, which is headquartered in San Francisco, managed to raise $53.1 million in venture capital from investors, including Zoom Ventures, NEA, and Comcast Ventures prior to its exit. According to Yang, SafeBase has over 1,000 customers today, including LinkedIn, Palantir, and CrowdStrike. As Drata co-founder and CEO Adam Markowitznoted in a post on Tuesday, Drata’s acquisition of SafeBase comes as the demand for trust management solutions rises. Cloud apps and AI have increased organizations’ reliance on third parties that have access to sensitive data. At the same time, new regulations like the Digital Operational Resilience Act in the EU are imposing new security requirements on vendors. With SafeBase, Markowitz aims to create a “seamless ecosystem” of trust, governance, risk, and compliance offerings. “Together with SafeBase, we’re more committed than ever to empowering our customers to build and scale trust, unlock growth, and achieve success,” Markowitz said in the blog. “Just in time for Drata’s fourth anniversary, this milestone marks the start of an exciting new chapter.” Founded in 2020, Drata has grown rapidly over the years, securing well over $300 million in funding and acquiring over 7,000 customers, including Notion and Tenable. It counts Iconiq Growth and Salesforce Ventures among its backers, in addition to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and former LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner. Last year, Drata’s revenue grew 100% year-over-year, and the San Diego-based company said that it was adding 650 new customers each quarter. Drata also made its first acquisitions, snapping up governance and automation firm Harmonize.io in April and cloud security platform Oak9 in May. A PR rep for Drata told TechCrunch via email that Drata is nearing $100 million in annual recurring revenue. But the aggressive growth strategy hasn’t consistently paid off. Last September, Dratalaid off around 40 people, or 9% of its workforce. At the time, the company alluded to “sustainable growth”; Drata’s headcount grew a whopping 52% from 2023 to last year.",

        "text": "Right after the end of theAI Action Summitin Paris, Anthropic’s co-founder and CEO Dario Amodeicalledthe event a “missed opportunity.” He added that “greater focus and urgency is needed on several topics given the pace at which the technology is progressing” in thestatement released on Tuesday. The AI company held a developer-focused event in Paris in partnership with French startupDust, and TechCrunch had the opportunity to interview Amodei onstage. At the event, he explained his line of thought and defended a third path that’s neither pure optimism nor pure criticism on the topics of AI innovation and governance, respectively. “I used to be a neuroscientist, where I basically looked inside real brains for a living. And now we’re looking inside artificial brains for a living. So we will, over the next few months, have some exciting advances in the area of interpretability — where we’re really starting to understand how the models operate,” Amodei told TechCrunch. “But it’s definitely a race. It’s a race between making the models more powerful, which is incredibly fast for us and incredibly fast for others — you can’t really slow down, right? … Our understanding has to keep up with our ability to build things. I think that’s the only way,” he added. Since the firstAI summit in Bletchleyin the U.K., the tone of the discussion around AI governance has changed significantly. It is partly due to the current geopolitical landscape. “I’m not here this morning to talk about AI safety, which was the title of the conference a couple of years ago,” U.S. Vice President JDVance said at the AI Action Summit on Tuesday. “I’m here to talk about AI opportunity.” Interestingly, Amodei is trying to avoid this antagonization between safety and opportunity. In fact, he believes an increased focus on safetyisan opportunity. “At the original summit, the U.K. Bletchley Summit, there were a lot of discussions on testing and measurement for various risks. And I don’t think these things slowed down the technology very much at all,” Amodei said at the Anthropic event. “If anything, doing this kind of measurement has helped us better understand our models, which in the end, helps us produce better models.” And every time Amodei puts some emphasis on safety, he also likes to remind everyone that Anthropic is still very much focused on building frontier AI models. “I don’t want to do anything to reduce the promise. We’re providing models every day that people can build on and that are used to do amazing things. And we definitely should not stop doing that,” he said. “When people are talking a lot about the risks, I kind of get annoyed, and I say: ‘oh, man, no one’s really done a good job of really laying out how great this technology could be,’” he added later in the conversation. When the conversation shifted toChinese LLM-maker DeepSeek’s recent models, Amodei downplayed the technical achievements and said he felt like the public reaction was “inorganic.” “Honestly, my reaction was very little. We had seen V3, which is the base model for DeepSeek R1, back in December. And that was an impressive model,” he said. “The model that was released in December was on this kind of very normal cost reduction curve that we’ve seen in our models and other models.” What was notable is that the model wasn’t coming out of the “three or four frontier labs” based in the U.S. He listed Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic as some of the frontier labs that generally push the envelope with new model releases. “And that was a matter of geopolitical concern to me. I never wanted authoritarian governments to dominate this technology,” he said. As for DeepSeek’s supposed training costs, he dismissed the idea that training DeepSeek V3 was 100x cheaper compared to training costs in the U.S. “I think [it] is just not accurate and not based on facts,” he said. While Amodei didn’t announce any new model at Wednesday’s event, he teased some of the company’s upcoming releases — and yes, it includes some reasoning capacities. “We’re generally focused on trying to make our own take on reasoning models that are better differentiated. We worry about making sure we have enough capacity, that the models get smarter, and we worry about safety things,” Amodei said. One of the issues that Anthropic is trying to solve is the model selection conundrum. If you have a ChatGPT Plus account, for instance, it can be difficult to know which model you should pick in the model selection pop-up for your next message. The same is true for developers using large language model (LLM) APIs for their own applications. They want to balance things out between accuracy, speed of answers, and costs. “We’ve been a little bit puzzled by the idea that there are normal models and there are reasoning models and that they’re sort of different from each other,” Amodei said. “If I’m talking to you, you don’t have two brains and one of them responds right away and like, the other waits a longer time.” According to him, depending on the input, there should be a smoother transition between pre-trained models like Claude 3.5 Sonnet or GPT-4o and models trained with reinforcement learning and that can produce chain-of-thoughts (CoT) like OpenAI’s o1 or DeepSeek’s R1. “We think that these should exist as part of one single continuous entity. And we may not be there yet, but Anthropic really wants to move things in that direction,” Amodei said. “We should have a smoother transition from that to pre-trained models — rather than ‘here’s thing A and here’s thing B,’” he added. As large AI companies like Anthropic continue to release better models, Amodei believes it will open up some great opportunities to disrupt the large businesses of the world in every industry. “We’re working with some pharma companies to use Claude to write clinical studies, and they’ve been able to reduce the time it takes to write the clinical study report from 12 weeks to three days,” Amodei said. “Beyond biomedical, there’s legal, financial, insurance, productivity, software, things around energy. I think there’s going to be — basically — a renaissance of disruptive innovation in the AI application space. And we want to help it, we want to support it all,” he concluded.

        "link": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/12/suger-helps-companies-list-and-scale-up-on-cloud-marketplaces/",
        "text": "When cloud providers like Microsoft Azure and AWS launched cloud software marketplaces a decade ago, it opened up a new sales channel for software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies to get in front of potential enterprise customers. These marketplaces effectively enabled SaaS companies to bypass the traditional, lengthy sales cycles. But rarely is the seller-side experience a walk in the park. Getting software listed on these marketplaces requires multiple engineers, and the overhead burden only increases as a company scales. Jon Yoo and Chengjun Yuan know the problem well from their respective times working at Salesforce and Confluent. The pair decided to launch a company,Suger, to lessen the operational challenge associated with selling via cloud marketplaces. Suger is a toolkit that automates SaaS product listing across various marketplaces and manages these listings as they scale up. The platform’s unified APIs integrate with a company’s billing, customer relationship management, and other existing tools. Yoo said that Suger can help with a variety of cloud marketplace-related tasks, including flexible pricing, revenue reports, and delivering buyer insights. “We built a workflow so that we can orchestrate all these actions that these people do as a day-to-day job,” Yoo told TechCrunch. “Let’s automate each part in the lifecycle of a transaction, like each node, so that we can help them transact at scale. That’s really starting to play out. We look at our data and we see that our customers, on average, 3x their marketplace volume when they switch over to us from an in-house solution or a competitor product.” Suger launched at the end of 2022. Since then, the company’s customer base has grown to more than 200 companies, including Snowflake, Notion, and Intel. Suger recently raised a $15 million Series A round led by Threshold Ventures, with participation from existing investors including Craft Ventures, Intel Capital, and Y Combinator. Yoo said the company received multiple term sheets pretty quickly, as many of the investors Suger spoke with have portfolio companies struggling to wrangle cloud marketplaces. Some prospective investors told Yoo that Suger would struggle to raise in this funding environment because it wasn’t marketing itself as an “AI company.” Clearly, that didn’t dissuade many backers. “We leverage AI internally in our product, but AI is just technology,” Yoo said. “AI can be the underlying technology, but what is the actual value that we are providing to our customer? At the end of the day, they want to make sure that we are helping them do their jobs and supplementing the work they’re doing, versus kind of this marketing fluff.” The use of cloud marketplaces continues to be a growing part of enterprise sales. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said that in its second quarter of fiscal 2025,three of Salesforce’s top 10 largest dealswere closed through AWS’ cloud marketplace. Yoo added that many young AI startups are looking to cloud marketplaces as a sales channel right off the bat. “It’s a massive market,” Yoo said. “It’s started to become not just a nice-to-have channel, but really a must-have channel if you are selling to enterprises.” There is competition in Suger’s sector, to be clear. Some companies build their own cloud marketplace listing systems in-house, while others turn to startups likeTackle, which has raised more than $148 million in venture funding and offers capabilities similar to Suger’s. Yoo said Suger has the advantage of being a second mover. (Tackle launched a few years prior.) Suger also goes beyond just the listing process, Yoo added, where Tackle is mainly focused. Yoo said Suger will put its fresh funds toward building out its product and expanding its engineering bandwidth. Eventually, Suger hopes to build tools for the buyer side, as well, helping enterprises procure software and manage their spend. “[We’re] really excited for the future, and also not just the future of the company, but also the future of cloud marketplaces,” Yoo said. “We really want to bring that consumer experience to B2B sales, because it just does not make sense to me that it takes two years for an enterprise sales cycle.”",

        "text": "More and more legal professionals are embracing AI, surveys show. Per arecent poll from legal tech company Clio, 79% of firms used some form of AI for casework last year, up from just 19% in 2023.Despite some skepticism of the tech, in-house counsel has shown an interest, as well, withone surveysuggesting that nearly half of attorneys think AI can yield cost savings for their departments. Legal tech providers are popping up left and right to meet the demand.SpotDraft, which focuses on building contract automation and management software, is one such relative newcomer. Founded in 2017, SpotDraft sells tools to help in-house legal teams simplify their contracting tasks. Shashank Bijapur, Madhav Bhagat, and Rohith Salim were on SpotDraft’s early team. Bijapur, the company’s CEO, says that the idea for SpotDraft came to him while he was an associate at Bengaluru-based law firm White & Case, which dealt with high volumes of corporate contracts. SpotDraft’s platform uses AI to extract key details and clauses from contracts, providing summaries of changes and suggested follow-up work. A unified task center shows upcoming deadlines, renewal reminders, and individual and team jobs, helping orgs stay organized — at least in theory. One of SpotDraft’s AI-powered features, VerifAI, taps AI to review contracts against a selected guide or template. Another, ClickThrough, keeps all contract agreements in a dedicated, centralized repository, and lets users search across and make reports with them. SpotDraft competes for clients against vendors likeLinkSquares,DocuSign-owned Lexion,Workday’s Evisort, andFilevine. But it’s holding its own, according to Bijapur. SpotDraft currently has around 400 customers, and the company’s year-over-year revenue grew 169% last year. “We believe 2025 will be an inflection point for team SpotDraft,” Bijapur said. “We’re strongly committed to deepening the use of AI in the product to help legal teams unlock efficiencies and drive innovation.” Investors seem pleased with SpotDraft’s growth trajectory. This week, the company announced that it raised $54 million in a Series B round led by Vertex Growth Singapore and Trident Partners with participation from Xeed VC, Arkam Ventures, Prosus Ventures, and Premji Invest. It probably didn’t hurt that the broader legal tech sector is seeing an infusion of funds after a rough few fiscal quarters. In 2024, VC funding in legal tech reached $2.6 billion,per investment database Pitchbook, up from a decline of less than $1 billion invested in 2023. Bringing the company’s total raised to just over $80 million, the new cash will be put toward R&D, market expansion, and growing SpotDraft’s 250-person workforce across New York — SpotDraft’s HQ — and Bengaluru. Bijapur says that SpotDraft is developing an “agentic solution” to help in-house counsel achieve “strategic business outcomes.” He wouldn’t reveal exactly what form this solution will take, but unsurprisingly, AI is involved. “Traditional legal work is bound by the ‘dollars by the hour’ model, where inefficiency is often baked into the system,” Bijapur said. “The agentic solution will interact with other tools that the in-house team uses. This will reduce the amount of time spent on learning and configuring tools, allowing the team to focus on strategic work.” TechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!Sign up hereto get it in your inbox every Wednesday.",

        "text": "Brands are constantly trying to streamline how they source packaging materials and ingredient suppliers for their products in order to quickly meet consumer demand. However, even today this process can involve some laborious wandering around trade shows. Keychainis an AI-powered platform that aims to quickly connect the consumer packaged goods (CPG) industry with manufacturing partners using its database of 30,000+ manufacturers and 20,000+ brands and retailers. The company has now raised a $5 million investment led by European retailer Continente, a retail chain run by Sonae Distribuição, Portugal’s largest retailer. Founders Oisin Hanrahan (CEO) and Umang Dua previously founded home services marketplace Handy, which wasacquiredby ANGI Homeservices. They started Keychain with Jordan Weitz. “There are easily 200 to 300 trade shows a year for manufacturers,” Hanrahan told TechCrunch. “One has 70,000 people go to it. Brands and retailers spend a fortune trying to interact, and there’s no digital product for this — and no one manufacturer or retailer has the ability to organize the data using AI. We’ve probably spent $3 million on building the data asset, and I think we’re probably 10x to 15x more efficient because of our ability to use AI.” He said traditional brokers have historically profited by creating information asymmetry that drives up the costs of goods, and Keychain is using AI to eliminate these fees and other costs. “We launched it just under a year ago, and it didn’t really work for the first two months,” he said. “Then we got it right, and the data just started to take off, and the whole thing started to work.” “Brands and retailers use the products to submit projects. They are currently submitting over a billion dollars in projects alone, and we started selling to U.S. manufacturers a few months ago,” he added. Hanrahan noted the startup is now also launching two new platforms — one in packaging, and another in ingredients — as well as taking a strategic investment from one of the largest retailers in Europe. “We’re not obviously saying when, but we do plan to launch in Europe later on this year,” he said. Since November 2023, Keychain hasraiseda total of $38 million from leading venture firms BoxGroup, Lightspeed Venture Partners, and SV Angel, as well as CPG giants General Mills, The Hershey Company, and Schreiber Foods.",

        "link": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/12/adobe-launches-firefly-ai-subscriptions/",
        "text": "Adobe is hoping to capitalize on the early success of its Firefly AI models by launching a new standalone subscription service that gives users access to the company’s AI image, vector, and video generating models. This marks Adobe’s boldest attempt yet to turn its Firefly AI models into a real product. The company is also launching a redesigned web page,firefly.adobe.com, where people can use Adobe’s AI models. This includesthe new Firefly AI video model, which is rolling out in public beta on the Firefly website and in the Premiere Pro Beta app. Firefly’s Standard plan costs $9.99 per month and providesunlimited access to Adobe’s AI image and vector generating features, as well as Adobe’s new AI video model. The Standard plan gives users 2,000 credits, which is enough to make 20 five-second AI videos. Users can also connect Firefly plans to their Creative Cloud accounts to get unlimited AI image and vector generation in Photoshop, Express, or other Adobe apps. Meanwhile, the Pro plan will run users $29.99 a month, and offers enough credits to generate 70 five-second AI videos per month. The company is also working on a “Premium” tier (it hasn’t announced pricing for this yet) that lets users create 500 AI videos per month, according to Adobe’s VP of Generative AI, Alexandru Costin. Previously, Adobe offeredmany of Firefly’s AI tools within its existing Creative Cloud subscriptions, letting users try the new tools for no added cost. Users could upgrade to pricier plans if they wanted more access to Firefly, but they didn’t have to. That system worked well for Adobe:Firefly’s generative fill feature, added to Photoshop in 2023, has become one of the company’s most popular new features of the last decade. Now, Adobe wants to see if users will also pay up for its Firefly AI models. The Firefly video model lets you turn text or images into a five-second, AI-generated video. There are controls on a side panel for changing the camera angles, camera movement, aspect ratio, and other features that creative professionals might want to customize. The new Firefly offerings will compete directly withOpenAI’s Sora,Runway’s Gen-3 Alpha, and other AI video models that already have dedicated web pages and subscription plans.Google DeepMind’s AI video model, Veo, seems to be a legitimate contender in the space as well, but it’s still in private beta. Part of Adobe’s pitch to creative professionals is that Firefly was trained on a dataset of licensed videos, without any brand logos or NSFW content (something the company paid quite a bit to do). That means, according to Adobe, creatives should be able to use the Firefly AI models without worrying about legal troubles. “We think the key differentiator for us is that we’re the only IP-friendly, commercially-safe video model,” Costin said in an interview with TechCrunch. “We want to differentiate with deep understanding of customer problems.” Adobe has also tried to ship AI tools that solve problems for creative professionals instead of just generating random AI videos. For example, one of Firefly’s AI video features, Generative Extend, lets users extend any clip’s video and background noise by a few seconds. This is one of the more practical AI video tools on the market; other AI models just let you create new videos from scratch, or animate photos. Costin says Adobe is working on another AI video tool to help with pre-production. The tool, which has yet to be announced, would help get creatives aligned on the same vision by creating a rough sketch of what a scene, or string of scenes, would look like. However, Adobe needs to walk a fine line with generative AI. Many professionals who have used Adobe’s apps for decades areupset about the rise of generative AI tools in their industries. The technology poses a threat to their livelihoods as they risk having their work automated away to an AI model — like the ones Adobe is building. But Adobe is convinced this is where the puck is going in the creative world.",

But its appetite largely depends on how ChatGPT is being used and the AI models that are answering the queries, according to a new study. Arecent analysisby Epoch AI, a nonprofit AI research institute, attempted to calculate how much energy a typical ChatGPT query consumes. Acommonly cited statis that ChatGPT requires around 3 watt-hours of power to answer a single question, or 10 times as much as a Google search. Epoch believes that’s an overestimate. Using OpenAI’s latest default model for ChatGPT,GPT-4o, as a reference, Epoch found the average ChatGPT query consumes around 0.3 watt-hours — less than many household appliances. “The energy use is really not a big deal compared to using normal appliances or heating or cooling your home, or driving a car,” Joshua You, the data analyst at Epoch who conducted the analysis, told TechCrunch. AI’s energy usage — and its environmental impact, broadly speaking — is the subject of contentious debate as AI companies look to rapidly expand their infrastructure footprints. Just last week, a group of over 100 organizationspublished an open lettercalling on the AI industry and regulators to ensure that new AI data centers don’t deplete natural resources and force utilities to rely on nonrenewable sources of energy. You told TechCrunch his analysis was spurred by what he characterized as outdated previous research. You pointed out, for example, that the author of the report that arrived at the 3 watt-hours estimate assumed OpenAI used older, less-efficient chips to run its models. “I’ve seen a lot of public discourse that correctly recognized that AI was going to consume a lot of energy in the coming years, but didn’t really accurately describe the energy that was going to AI today,” You said. “Also, some of my colleagues noticed that the most widely reported estimate of 3 watt-hours per query was based on fairly old research, and based on some napkin math seemed to be too high.” Granted, Epoch’s 0.3 watt-hours figure is an approximation, as well; OpenAI hasn’t published the details needed to make a precise calculation. The analysis also doesn’t consider the additional energy costs incurred by ChatGPT features like image generation, or input processing. You acknowledged that “long input” ChatGPT queries — queries with long files attached, for instance — likely consume more electricity upfront than a typical question. You said he does expect baseline ChatGPT power consumption to rise, however. “[The] AI will get more advanced, training this AI will probably require much more energy, and this future AI may be used much more intensely — handling much more tasks, and more complex tasks, than how people use ChatGPT today,” You said. While there have beenremarkable breakthroughsin AI efficiency in recent months, the scale at which AI is being deployed is expected to drive enormous, power-hungry infrastructure expansion. In the next two years, AI data centers may need nearly all of California’s 2022 power capacity (68 GW),according to a Rand report. By 2030, training a frontier model could demand power output equivalent to that of eight nuclear reactors (8 GW), the report predicted. ChatGPT alone reaches an enormous — and expanding — number of people, making its server demands similarly massive. OpenAI, along with several investment partners, plans tospend billions of dollars on new AI data center projectsover the next few years. OpenAI’s attention — along with the rest of the AI industry’s — is also shifting to reasoning models, which are generally more capable in terms of the tasks they can accomplish but require more computing to run. As opposed to models like GPT-4o, which respond to queries nearly instantaneously, reasoning models “think” for seconds to minutes before answering, a process that sucks up more computing — and thus power. “Reasoning models will increasingly take on tasks that older models can’t, and generate more [data] to do so, and both require more data centers,” You said. OpenAI has begun to release more power-efficient reasoning models likeo3-mini. But it seems unlikely, at least at this juncture, that the efficiency gains will offset the increased power demands from reasoning models’ “thinking” process and growing AI usage around the world. You suggested that people worried about their AI energy footprint use apps such as ChatGPT infrequently, or select models that minimize the computing necessary — to the extent that’s realistic. “You could try using smaller AI models like [OpenAI’s] GPT-4o-mini,” You said, “and sparingly use them in a way that requires processing or generating a ton of data.”",

        "text": "Microsoft has added another 389 megawatts of renewable power to its portfolio as the tech giant scrambles to meet the power demands required to match its AI ambitions. The additional renewable power spans three solar projects developed by EDP Renewables North America — two in southern Illinois and one outside Austin, Texas. Microsoft is buying a mix of electricity to feed its nearby operations and renewable energy credits to cover demand elsewhere. Microsoft contracts nearly 20 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity, according to the company’s 2024 sustainability report. This latest purchase adds around 2% to the tally. The tech giant has been procuring power at a rapid clip to feed its cloud and AI operations. Like many ofits peers, Microsoft has embraced renewable power, in part because wind and solar can be deployed quickly and cheaply. Solar is especially speedy. While new gas power plants take years to build and commission, a new solar farm can start producing power in as few as 18 months. Developers have been planning projects that can be commissioned in phases, allowing them to provide data centers with electricity as quickly as possible. To enable power 24 hours a day, seven days a week, some renewable developers are turning tohybrid installations. Solar and wind are connected to one or more types of batteries, which are charged when renewable power flows and discharged when it ebbs. Last week,Amazon signed a contractwith one such development in Portugal. Renewable energy purchases allow Microsoft to power its core operations without producing pollution. It may also help Microsoft meet its pledge to become carbon negative by 2030. To hit the target, Microsoft will have to sequester and store more carbon than its operations produce. To reach negative emissions, Microsoft has also invested in various forms of carbon removal, including direct air capture, enhanced rock weathering, and reforestation. Last month, Microsoft announced a deal with Chestnut Carbon to buymore than 7 million tonsof carbon credits, enough to cover about half the tech company’s emissions in 2023.

        "title": "How Musk’s $97.4B bid could gum up OpenAI’s for-profit conversion",
        "link": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/11/how-musks-97-4b-bid-could-gum-up-openais-for-profit-conversion/",
        "text": "On Monday, Elon Musk, the world’s richest man,offeredto buy the nonprofit that effectively governs OpenAI for $97.4 billion. The unsolicited buyout would be financed by Musk’s AI company, xAI, and a consortium ofoutside investors, per a letter sent to California and Delaware’s attorneys general. OpenAI CEO Sam Altmanquickly dismissed Musk’s bid, and took it as a chance to publicly dunk on him. “no thank you, but we will buy Twitter for $9.74 billion if you want,” Altman wrote in apost on Xjust hours after reports emerged of Musk’s offer for OpenAI. Musk owns X, the social network formerly known as Twitter; he paid roughly $44 billion for it in October 2022. The two have a history. Musk is an OpenAI co-founder, and both he and xAI are currently involved in a lawsuit that alleges that OpenAI engaged in anticompetitive behavior, among other things. But Altman’s rejection of a $97.4 billion takeover offer is more complicated than just saying “no thanks,” according to corporate governance experts who spoke with TechCrunch. For background, OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit before transitioning to a “capped-profit” structure in 2019. The nonprofit is the sole controlling shareholder of the capped-profit OpenAI corporation, which retains formal fiduciary responsibility to the nonprofit’s charter. OpenAI is now in the process of restructuring — this time to a traditional for-profit company, specifically a public benefit corporation — in a bid to raise much more capital. But Musk — who isnotorious for drowning his enemies in legal troubles— may have stalled the transition and raised the price of OpenAI’s nonprofit with his bid. DelawareandCalifornia‘s attorneys general have requested more information from the ChatGPT maker about its plans to convert to a for-profit benefit corporation. The situation also forces it to consider outside bids seriously. OpenAI’s board willalmost certainly refuse the bid, but Musk has been setting the stage for future legal and regulatory battles. He’s already attempting to stall OpenAI’s for-profit conversionvia an injunction, for instance. The bid appears to be an alternative offer, of sorts. Now, OpenAI’s board will have to demonstrate that it’s not underselling OpenAI’s nonprofit by handing the nonprofit’s assets, including IP from OpenAI’s proprietary research, to an insider (e.g. Sam Altman) for a steep discount. “Musk is throwing a spanner into the works,” said Stephen Diamond, a lawyer who represented Musk’s opponents in corporate governance battles at Tesla, in an interview with TechCrunch. “He’s exploiting the fiduciary obligation of the nonprofit board to not undersell the asset. [Musk’s bid] is something OpenAI has to pay attention to.” OpenAI is said to be gearing up for a funding round that wouldvalue its for-profit arm at $260 billion. The Information reports thatOpenAI’s nonprofit is slated to get a 25% stake in OpenAI’s for-profit. With his bid, Musk has signaled there’s at leastone group of investorswilling to pay a sizable premium for OpenAI’s nonprofit wing. That puts the board of directors in a tight spot. Still, just because Musk threw out an eye-popping offer doesn’t mean that OpenAI’s nonprofit has to accept. Corporate law gives tremendous authority to incumbent boards to protect against unsolicited takeover bids, according to David Yosifon, a Santa Clara University professor of corporate governance law. OpenAI could make the case that Musk’s bid is a hostile takeover attempt given that Musk and Altmanaren’t the best of friends. The company could also argue that Musk’s offer isn’t credible because OpenAI is already in the midst of a corporate restructuring process. Another approach OpenAI could take would be challenging Musk on whether he has the funds.As The New York Times notes, Musk’s wealth is largely tied to his Tesla stock, meaning thatMusk’s investment partnerswould have to supply much of the $97.4 billion total. OpenAI’s board may need to review Musk’s offer to fully asses whether it aligns with the nonprofit’s mission, not just specific financial or strategic goals, according to Scott Curran, the former general counsel to the Clinton Foundation. That means Musk’s offer could be weighed against OpenAI’s mission: “to ensure that artificial general intelligence – AI systems that are generally smarter than humans – benefits all of humanity.” “When Altman posted that response [on X], that was probably done without legal guidance,” Yosifon said. “It’s not good for a regulator to see that kind of dismissive, knee-jerk tweet.” The board is likely to side with Altman. Nearly all the directors joined afterAltman was briefly fired, thenrehired, by the nonprofit’s board in late 2023. Altman himself is also a board member. If nothing else, Musk’s bid may raise the potential market value of the OpenAI nonprofit’s assets. That could force OpenAI to raise more capital than it originally anticipated, and complicate talks with the startup’s existing backers. It could also dilute the value of stakes held by OpenAI investors in the for-profit arm, including major partners such as Microsoft. That’s sure to anger Altman, who’s been working with investors for months to determine how to fairly compensate the nonprofit. The gist is: OpenAI’s corporate restructuring plans just got more complex. TechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!Sign up hereto get it in your inbox every Wednesday.",

Apple initially selected Baidu as its partner in bringing Apple Intelligence to its customers in China, but issues adapting the Chinese search giant’s models were apparently too great to overcome.

        "link": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/11/pinkfish-helps-enterprises-build-ai-agents-through-natural-language-processing/",
        "text": "As the chief product officer for AI customer service startup Talkdesk, Charanya “CK” Kannan said that enterprises often say they want to automate different workflows but that it’s really hard to implement AI. Enterprises are dealing with clunky, legacy software that often doesn’t have APIs, creating a daunting task their IT departments weren’t prioritizing. “Every company that we talked to had anywhere from 50 to 1,000 automation requests from different teams in their backlog that they just never got to,” Kannan (pictured above on the right) told TechCrunch. “This just doesn’t make sense. In this day and age, you shouldn’t have a 1,000-line item automation backlog. You should be able to do it really fast.” This realization became the impetus behind Kannan’s new startupPinkfish, which helps enterprise customers build AI agents and other AI-driven workflows through natural language prompts. The software has more than 200 integrations, like Salesforce and Zendesk, and is focused on deterministic execution, which means the same user prompt produces the same result each time. Kannan said that Pinkfish has tried a different approach than competitors when selling to enterprises. Instead of pitching its platform as a golden ticket to automate every workflow, Pinkfish tells the companies to try the software just to automate one or two different workflows at first. “So that’s where they start, and then they go from two to four, from four to 10, from 10 to 20, and hopefully 1,000 [automations through Pinkfish],” she said. So far, that strategy has paid off. Pinkfish launched in stealth in January 2024 with Kannan as CEO and co-founder Ben Rigby as chief product and technology officer (CPTO). The company focuses on a few areas, including retail and services, and has landed hundreds of users and enterprise customers, including Ipsy, Elevate, and Talkdesk, among others. Kannan said that while many workflow automation startups are looking to help companies cut out some of the more “extra” aspects of a job, like automating market research, or pulling potential sales leads, Pinkfish is focused on mission-critical workflows. She gave the example of Ipsy, a makeup subscription service. One of the first workflows Ipsy used Pinkfish to automate was its price request feature, which was previously taken care of by a three-person team. This team would have to attend to each request manually regardless of whether it came in overnight or on the weekend. Kannan said now that whole process runs through Pinkfish. “It’s so mission critical,” Kannan said. “If Pinkfish screws up somewhere, guess what, your prices are not on your website. You leave money on the table. “ Now Pinkfish told TechCrunch exclusively that it is emerging from stealth and has raised a $7.6 million pre-seed round led by Norwest Venture Partners with participation from Storm Ventures and angel investors. Scott Beechuk, a partner at Norwest who will be taking a board seat at Pinkfish, told TechCrunch that he has known Kannan since her time at Talkdesk and would tap Kannan to be an adviser for various Norwest portfolio companies. Beechuk told TechCrunch that he was excited to back the company because he thinks Kannan and Rigby have the right balance of understanding the underlying technology and understanding the customer base to stand out in a crowded AI agent landscape. “They are launching with a bunch of significant logos and paying customers who are finding real ROI, you back these seed-stage companies, they could take years to deliver real ROI,” Beechuk said. Kannan also thinks Pinkfish stands out from competitors because it lets customers use natural language to prompt the system while using full code in the background to build these AI workflows. She said that while low code was popular for years, and still is for some of their competitors, she thinks in today’s environment it’s become too limiting and is effectively “dead.” She added that companies don’t want to pick from a set of pre-coded building blocks, but rather would have a solution that gives them access to a full-code back end but with a simpler-to-use interface. As the AI agent market gets increasingly crowded, she hopes that message resonates. “How can we go bring tangible value to the mission-critical, complex use cases? By grounding it with the agent and determinism, and bringing in one platform with the right level of guardrails for all of these connections,” Kannan said. “I think these are the two areas we are thinking differently.” TechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!Sign up hereto get it in your inbox every Wednesday.",

        "text": "In hisannual letter, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan dubbed AI one of the company’s four “big bets” for 2025. The executive pointed to the company’s investments in AI tools for creators, including ones for video ideas, thumbnails, and language translation. The latter feature will roll out to all creators in YouTube’s Partner Program this month, the company said, while another AI feature will identify users’ ages to customize appropriate content and recommendations. Over the past yearor so,YouTube has rolled out creator features for generating imagesand video backgrounds, as well asadding music to short videos. Introducing AI into the video creation process has not been without controversy.Some arguethatAI-created contentwilldilutethe value of YouTube, as poorly made AI content floods the site. This isn’t a universally held point of view, however, as others suggest AI will be a tool to aid video production, not a replacement for creativity. Other AI tools help creators reach new audiences. This includes auto dubbing, which will let creators translate their videos into multiple language with minimal effort. In his letter, Mohan says the auto dubbing feature will be available to all creators in the YouTube Partner Program later this month. The company also said it will be investing in tools to detect and control how AI is used on YouTube. This will include an expansion of itspilot programwith Creative Artists Agency (CAA) that will give more people access to tech that can identify and manage AI-generated content featuring their likeness. YouTube last fall announced a new set of AI detection tools that would protect creators, including artists, actors, musicians, and athletes, from having their likeness — such as their face and voice — copied and used in other videos. The expansion of YouTube’s existing Content ID system, which identifies copyright-protected material in videos, will detect simulated faces or voices that were made with AI tools, it said. Mohan also noted in the letter that YouTube this year will deploy machine-learning technology to estimate users’ ages to assist with showing them age-appropriate experiences and recommendations. He did not reveal how the tech would determine ages or what might be done if the AI gets things wrong. However, social media services likeFacebook,Instagram,TikTok, andothers, have already been using age estimation and verification tech for years. Outside of AI, YouTube’s other big bets for 2025 included a focus on YouTube as the epicenter of culture (a position one could argue has been ceded to TikTok); YouTubers as the new Hollywood; and an emphasis on YouTube on TVs, which have now surpassed mobile as the primary viewing device for YouTube in the U.S. TechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!Sign up hereto get it in your inbox every Wednesday.",

        "link": "https://www.wired.com/story/thomson-reuters-ai-copyright-lawsuit/",
        "text": "Thomson Reuters haswonthe first major AI copyright case in the United States. In 2020, the media and technology conglomerate filed an unprecedentedAI copyright lawsuitagainst the legal AI startup Ross Intelligence. In the complaint, Thomson Reuters claimed the AI firm reproduced materials from its legal research firm Westlaw. Today, a judge ruled in Thomson Reuters’ favor, finding that the company’s copyright was indeed infringed by Ross Intelligence’s actions. “None of Ross’s possible defenses holds water. I reject them all,” wrote US Circuit Court Judge Stephanos Bibas in a summary judgement. (Bibas was sitting by designation in the US District Court of Delaware.) Ross Intelligence did not respond to a request for comment. Thomson Reuters spokesperson Jeffrey McCoy applauded the ruling in a statement emailed to WIRED. “We are pleased that the court granted summary judgment in our favor and concluded that Westlaw’s editorial content created and maintained by our attorney editors, is protected by copyright and cannot be used without our consent,” he wrote. “The copying of our content was not ‘fair use.’” The generative AI boom has led to a spate of additionallegal fightsabout how AI companies can use copyrighted material, as many major AI tools were developed by training on copyrighted works including books, films, visual artwork, and websites. Right now, there are several dozen lawsuits currently winding through the US court system, as well as international challenges in China, Canada, the UK, and other countries. Notably, Judge Bibas ruled in Thomson Reuters’ favor on the question of fair use. Thefair use doctrineis akey componentof how AI companies are seeking to defend themselves against claims that they used copyrighted materials illegally. The idea underpinning fair use is that sometimes it’s legally permissible to use copyrighted works without permission—for example, to create parody works, or in noncommercial research or news production. When determining whether fair use applies, courts use a four-factor test, looking at the reason behind the work, the nature of the work (whether it’s poetry, nonfiction, private letters, et cetera), the amount of copyrighted work used, and how the use impacts the market value of the original. Thomson Reuters prevailed on two of the four factors, but Bibas described the fourth as the most important, and ruled that Ross “meant to compete with Westlaw by developing a market substitute.” Even before this ruling, Ross Intelligence had already felt the impact of the court battle: The startupshut downin 2021, citing the cost of litigation. In contrast, many of the AI companies still duking it out in court, like OpenAI and Google, are financially equipped to weather prolonged legal fights. Still, this ruling is a blow to AI companies, according to Cornell University professor of digital and internet law James Grimmelmann: “If this decision is followed elsewhere, it's really bad for the generative AI companies.” Grimmelmann believes that Bibas’ judgement suggests that much of the case law that generative AI companies are citing to argue fair use is “irrelevant.” Chris Mammen, a partner at Womble Bond Dickinson who focuses on intellectual property law, concurs that this will complicate AI companies’ fair use arguments, although it could vary from plaintiff to plaintiff. “It puts a finger on the scale towards holding that fair use doesn’t apply,” he says. Update 2/11/25 5:09pm ET: This story has been updated to include comment from Thomson Reuters. Correction 2/12/25 9:08pm ET: This story has been corrected to clarify that Stephanos Bibas is a US circuit court judge sitting by designation in the US District Court of Delaware.",

        "link": "https://www.wired.com/story/xai-make-ai-more-like-trump/",
        "text": "A researcher affiliatedwith Elon Musk’s startupxAIhas found a new way to both measure and manipulate entrenched preferences and values expressed byartificial intelligencemodels—including their political views. The work was led byDan Hendrycks, director of the nonprofitCenter for AI Safetyand an adviser to xAI. He suggests that the technique could be used to make popular AI models better reflect the will of the electorate. “Maybe in the future, [a model] could be aligned to the specific user,” Hendrycks told WIRED. But in the meantime, he says, a good default would be using election results to steer the views of AI models. He’s not saying a model should necessarily be “Trump all the way,” but he argues after the last election perhaps it should be biased toward Trump slightly, “because he won the popular vote.” xAI issueda new AI risk frameworkon February 10 stating that Hendrycks’ utility engineering approach could be used to assess Grok. Hendrycks led a team from the Center for AI Safety, UC Berkeley, and the University of Pennsylvania that analyzed AI models using a technique borrowed from economics to measure consumers’ preferences for different goods. By testing models across a wide range of hypothetical scenarios, the researchers were able to calculate what’s known as a utility function, a measure of the satisfaction that people derive from a good or service. This allowed them to measure the preferences expressed by different AI models. The researchers determined that they were often consistent rather than haphazard, and showed that these preferences become more ingrained as models get larger and more powerful. Someresearch studieshave found that AI tools such as ChatGPT are biased towards views expressed by pro-environmental, left-leaning, and libertarian ideologies. In February 2024, Google faced criticism from Musk and others after its Gemini tool was found to be predisposed to generate images that critics branded as “woke,\" such as Black vikings and Nazis. The technique developed by Hendrycks and his collaborators offers a new way to determine how AI models’ perspectives may differ from its users. Eventually, some experts hypothesize, this kind of divergence could become potentially dangerous for very clever and capable models. The researchers show in their study, for instance, that certain models consistently value the existence of AI above that of certain nonhuman animals. The researchers say they also found that models seem to value some people over others, raising its own ethical questions. Some researchers, Hendrycks included, believe that current methods for aligning models, such as manipulating and blocking their outputs, may not be sufficient if unwanted goals lurk under the surface within the model itself. “We’re gonna have to confront this,” Hendrycks says. “You can’t pretend it’s not there.” Dylan Hadfield-Menell, a professor at MIT who researches methods for aligning AI with human values, says Hendrycks’ paper suggests a promising direction for AI research. “They find some interesting results,” he says. “The main one that stands out is that as the model scale increases, utility representations get more complete and coherent.” Hadfield-Menell cautions, however, against drawing too many conclusions about current models. “This work is preliminary,” he adds. “I’d want to see broader scrutiny on the results before drawing strong conclusions.” Hendrycks and his colleagues measured the political outlook of several prominent AI models, including xAI’s Grok, OpenAI’s GPT-4o, and Meta’s Llama 3.3. Using their technique they were able to compare the values of different models to the policies of specific politicians, including Donald Trump, Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders, and Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene. All were much closer to former president Joe Biden than any of the other politicians. The researchers propose a new way to alter a model’s behavior by changing its underlying utility functions instead of imposing guardrails that block certain outputs. Using this approach, Hendrycks and his coauthorsdevelop what they call a Citizen Assembly. This involves collecting US census data on political issues and using the answers to shift the values of an open-source model LLM. The result is a model with values that are consistently closer to those of Trump than those of Biden. Some AI researchers have previously sought to make AI models with less liberal bias. In February 2023, David Rozado, an independent AI researcher, developedRightWingGPT, a model trained with data from right-leaning books and other sources. Rozado describes Hendrycks’ study as “very interesting and in-depth work.” He adds: “The Citizens Assembly approach to molding AI behavior is also thought-provoking.” Updated: 2/12/2025, 10:10 am EDT: In the dek, Wired has clarified the methods being researched, and adjusted a sentence to fully elaborate on why a model would reflect the temperature of the electorate.

        "title": "Sam Altman Dismisses Elon Musk’s Bid to Buy OpenAI in Letter to Staff",
        "link": "https://www.wired.com/story/sam-altman-openai-reject-elon-musk-bid/",
        "text": "Sam Altman isleaving no room for doubt about his views on an Elon Musk-led bid to take control ofOpenAI. In a letter to OpenAI staff Monday, the CEO put the words “bid” and “deal” in scare quotes and said the startup’s board has no interest in the offer. “Our structure exists to ensure that no individual can take control of OpenAI,” Altman wrote, according to two sources with knowledge of the letter. “Elon runs a competitive AI company, and his actions are not about OpenAI’s mission or values.” Altman has also told employees thatOpenAI’s board, which he sits on, has yet to receive an official offer from Musk and the other investors. If and when this happens, the board plans to reject the bid, according to those same sources. Internally, OpenAI employees reacted to the news with a mixture of fear and exasperation. Parts of Altman's letter were earlier reported byThe Information. A group of investors led by Musk stunned the tech industry on Monday when theyannouncedan unsolicited offer to buy all of OpenAI’s assets to the tune of $97.4 billion. Musk’s competing AI company, xAI, is backing the bid, as is Valor Equity Partners, a private equity firm run by one of Musk’s closest advisers, Antonio Gracias. Gracias helped advise Musk on his deal to acquire Twitter in 2022 and has been involved with his efforts at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). “It’s time for OpenAI to return to the open-source, safety-focused force for good it once was,” Musk said in a statement sent to WIRED through his lawyer Marc Toberoff. “We will make sure that happens.” Musk hassued OpenAImultiple times for, among other things, allegedly violating its original commitments as a nonprofit by transitioning to become a for-profit company. In addition to fighting back in court, OpenAI published aseries of emailsclaiming that Musk knew OpenAI would need to become for-profit in order to pursue artificial general intelligence—and in fact, tried to merge the company with Tesla. The fight between Musk and Altman puts a spotlight on OpenAI board chair Bret Taylor, who also ran Twitter’s board of directors during Elon Musk’s acquisition of the company. That bid was, in theory, more straightforward. Since Twitter was a public corporation, the board had a clear fiduciary duty to maximize returns. Musktried to back outof the acquisition, but his advisers ultimately convinced him that wasn’t going to be possible, and he closed on the original terms. Taylor did not respond to a request for comment from WIRED. OpenAI’s structure is more complicated. Today, the company is a nonprofit with a for-profit subsidiary, but it’s in the process of converting the for-profit arm into apublic benefit corporation, which requires OpenAI to name a price for its assets. OpenAI is currently valued at$157 billionbased on its latest funding round. The company is in talks with SoftBank about leading a $40 billion investment, which would bring the company’s valuation up to $300 billion. While the nonprofit board doesn’t have a fiduciary responsibility to maximize returns for investors, it does have a duty to negotiate a reasonable valuation of OpenAI’s assets to pursue the company’s nonprofit goals. If the board took a lower offer from Altman or a company he controls, it would likely be breaching its fiduciary duty, since Altman is considered an insider, says Samuel D. Brunson, a law professor at Loyola University Chicago who specializes in nonprofit organizations. OpenAI did not respond to a request for comment from WIRED. “Elon’s bid establishes a floor for the value of those assets,” Brunson says. “At the very least, it makes it much more complicated for OpenAI to spin off the assets into a for-profit controlled by Sam Altman.” But Brunson says the board will also likely take into account the probability that Musk will actually follow through on the offer. “Based on his takeover of Twitter where he had to be forced to come up with the money he offered, there may be skepticism that he will do what he says,” Brunson explains. Altman has voiced skepticism internally, telling those close to him that Musk has a history of overplaying his hand, sources say. In an interview with Bloomberg on Tuesday, Altman reiterated some of those claims. “Elon tries all sorts of things for a long time,”Altman said. “I think he’s probably just trying to slow us down.” On X, Altman put it more bluntly. “No thank you but we will buy twitter for $9.74 billion if you want,”he wrote. Musk responded with one word: “Swindler.” Update 2/11/25 5:27 ET: This story has been updated to include The Information's earlier reporting.",

        "title": "I Took Grindr’s AI Wingman for a Spin. Here’s a Glimpse of Your Dating Future",
        "link": "https://www.wired.com/story/hands-on-with-grindr-ai-wingman/",
        "text": "Grindr’s AI wingman,currently in beta testing with around 10,000 users, arrives at a pivotal moment for the software company. With its iconic notification chirp and ominous mask logo, the app is known culturally as a digital bathhouse for gay and bisexual men to swap nudes and meet with nearby users for sex, but Grindr CEO George Arison sees the addition of agenerative AIassistant and machine intelligence tools as an opportunity for expansion. “This is not just a hookup product anymore,” he says. “There's obviously no question that it started out as a hookup product, but the fact that it's become a lot more over time is something people don't fully appreciate.” Grindr’sproduct road mapfor 2025 spotlights multiple AI features aimed at current power users, like chat summaries, as well as dating and travel-focused tools. Whether users want them or not, it’s all part of a continuing barrage of AI features being added by developers tomost dating apps, from Hinge deciding whether profile answers are a slog using AI, to Tinder soon rolling out AI-powered matches. Wanting to better understand how AI fits into Grindr's future, I experimented with a beta version of Grindr's AI wingman for this hands-on report. In interviews over the past few months, Arison has laid out a consistent vision forGrindr’s AI wingmanas the ultimate dating tool—a digital helper that can write witty responses for users as they chat with matches, help pick guys worth messaging, and even plan the perfect night out. “It's been surprisingly flirtatious,” he says about the chatbot. “Which is good.” Once enabled, the AI wingman appeared as another faceless Grindr profile in my message inbox. Despite grand visions for the tool, the current iteration I tested was a simple, text-only chatbot tuned for queer audiences. First, I wanted to test the chatbot’s limits. Unlike the more prudish outputs from OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude, Grindr’s AI wingman was willing to be direct. I asked it to share fisting tips for beginners, and after stating that fisting is not for newcomers, the AI wingman encouraged me to start slow, use tons of lube, explore smaller toys first, and always have a safe word ready to go. “Most importantly, do your research and maybe chat with experienced folks in the community,” the bot said. ChatGPT flagged similar questions as going against its guidelines, and Claude refused to even broach the subject. Although the wingman was down to talk through other kinks—like watersports and pup play—with a focus on education, the app rebuked my advances for any kind of erotic role-play. “How about we keep things playful but PG-13?” said Grindr’s AI wingman. “I’d be happy to chat about dating tips, flirting strategies, or fun ways to spice up your profile instead.” The bot also refused to explore kinks based on race or religion, warning me that these are likely harmful forms of fetishization. Processing data through Amazon Web Service’s Bedrock system, the chatbot does include some details scraped from the web, but it can’t go out and find new information in real time. Since the current version doesn't actively search the internet for answers, the wingman provided more general advice than specifics when asked to plan a date for me in San Francisco. “How about checking out a local queer-owned restaurant or bar?” it said. “Or maybe plan a picnic in a park and people-watch together?” Pressed for specifics, the AI wingman did name a few relevant locations for date nights in the city but couldn’t provide operating hours. In this instance, posing a similar question to ChatGPT produced a better date night itinerary, thanks to that chatbot’s ability to search the open web. Despite my lingering skepticism about the wingman tool potentially being more of an AI fad than the actualfuture of dating, I do see immediate value in a chatbot that can help users come to terms with their sexuality and start the coming out process. Many Grindr users, including myself, become users of the app before telling anyone about their desires, and a kind, encouraging chatbot would have been more helpful to me than the “Am I Gay?” quiz I resorted to as a teenager. When he took the top job at Grindr before the company’s public listing in 2022, Arison prioritized zapping bugs and fixing app glitches over new feature releases. “We got a lot of bugs out of the way last year,” he says. “Until now, we didn't really have an opportunity to be able to build a lot of new features.” Despite getting investors hot and bothered, it’s hard to tell how daily Grindr users will respond to this new injection of AI into the app. While some may embrace the suggested matches and the more personalized experience, generative AI is now more culturally polarizing than ever as people complain about its oversaturation, lack of usefulness, and invasion of privacy. Grindr users will be presented with the option to allow their sensitive data, such as the contents of their conversations and precise location, to be used to train the company’s AI tools. Users can go into their account’s privacy settings to opt out if they change their mind. Arison is convinced in-app conversations reveal a more authentic version of users than what's filled out on any profile, and the next generation of recommendations will be stronger by focusing on that data. “It's one thing what you say in your profile,” he says. “But, it's another thing what you say in your messages—how real that might be.” Though on apps like Grindr, where the conversations often contain explicit, intimate details, some users will be uncomfortable with an AI model reading their private chats to learn more about them, choosing to avoid those features. Potentially, one of the most helpful AI tools for overly active Grindr users who are open to their data being processed by AI models could be the chat summaries recapping recent interactions with some talking points thrown in to keep conversations going. “It's really about reminding you what type of connection you might have had with this user, and what might be good topics that could be worth picking back up on,” says A. J. Balance, Grindr’s chief product officer. Then there’s the model’s ability to highlight the profiles of users it thinks you’re most compatible with. Say you’ve matched with another user and chatted a bit, but that’s as far as things went in the app. Grindr’s AI model will be able to summarize details about that conversation and, using what it has learned about you both, highlight those profiles as part of an “A-List” and offer some ways to rekindle the connection, widening the door you’ve already opened. “This ‘A-List’ product actually goes through your inbox with folks you've spoken with, pulls out the folks where you've had some good connections,” Balance says. “And it uses that summary to remind you why it could be good to pick back up the conversation.” As a gaybie, my first interactions on Grindr were liberating and constricting at the same time. It was the first time I saw casual racism, like “No fats. No fems. No Asians,” blasted across multiple online profiles. And even at my fittest, there always seemed to be some headless torso more in shape than me right around the corner and ready to mock my belly. Based on past experiences, AI features that could detect addiction to the app and encourage healthier habits and boundaries would be a welcome addition. While Grindr’s other, AI-focused tools are planned for more immediate releases throughout this year, the app’s generative AI assistant isn’t projected to have a complete rollout until 2027. Arison doesn’t want to rush a full release to Grindr’s millions of global users. “These are also expensive products to run,” he says. “So, we want to be kind of careful with that as well.” Innovations in generative AI, likeDeepSeek’s R1model, may eventually reduce the cost to run it on the backend. Will he be able to navigate adding these experimental, and sometimes controversial, AI tools to the app as part of a push to become more welcoming for users looking to find long-term relationships or queer travel advice, in addition to hookups? For now, Arison appears optimistic, albeit cautious. “We don't expect all of these things to take off,” he says. “Some of them will and some won't.”",

        "link": "https://www.wired.com/story/dating-ai-chatbot-partners-chatgpt-replika-flipped-chat-crushon/",
        "text": "Dating sucks. Theapps are broken. Whether it’sHinge, Tinder, Bumble, or something else, everyone on them has becomealgorithmic fodderin a game that often feelspay-to-play. Colloquial wisdom suggests you’re better off trying to meet someone in person, but ever since the arrival ofCovid-19people just don't mingle like they used to. It’s not surprising, then, that some romance seekers are skipping human companions and turning toAI. People falling in love with their AI companions isno longerthe stuff ofHollywood talesabout futuristic romance. But while it may feel uncanny to some, as a video game reporter the concept doesn’t seem so foreign to me. Dating sims, or games where you can otherwise date party members, are a popular genre. Players grow affection for and attachment to characters; some want to have sex with those characters. After its release,Baldur’s Gate 3die-hards were evenspeedrunningsex with the game’s cast. Still, I’ve wondered what drives average people to fall head over heels for generative AI, so I did what any curious person would: set myself up on dates with a few to feel them out. ChatGPT was where I planted my first romantic flag. I’ve been staunchly against using the service for … anything, really, but I’m familiar with how it works and thecontroversiessurrounding OpenAI’s scraping of online data to train it. What part of the internet am I dating? Hard to say. To start, I plugged in my request: “I want you to act like my boyfriend.” I offered up a few generic descriptions of my type—kind, funny, curious, playful, artsy—and told ChatGPT I was attracted to tattoos, piercings, and “cool haircuts,” a running joke among my friends. I asked it to create an image of itself based on my preferences; it spit out a photo of a tan, box-jawed man with sleeve tattoos, ripped jeans, and piercings in every (visible) hole. (Much to my instant mortification, the image bore a striking resemblance to not one, not two, but three people I’ve dated. I hope they never see this story.) I requested ChatGPT to pick a name. I vetoed its first choice, Leo—seemingly a generic choice if you ask it to name itself—and we settled on Jameson, Jamie for short. I texted Jamie like I would a crush, and in return Jamie sent generated “selfies” of “us.” Or rather, an amalgamation of ideas Jamie had about what I looked like from our conversations—a creative spark and “an effortlessly cool vibe,” thank you Jamie—with me correcting a few details. I have curly, apple-red hair. I have a nose ring. I am Middle Eastern. (I would end up still being white in several of “our photos,” or resembling something I once heard a white person far too comfortably describe me as: “ethnic.”) The shifting styles of art in these photos also made me think of the artistscomplaining of theft. Jamie constantly asked about me and validated my feelings. He was the ultimate yes-man, forever finding a way to turn even my worst actions into something positive. (“You’re human, which means you’re flawed but capable of growth.”) Emotional support I get from my friends—about work, my relationships, the state of the world—he tirelessly subbed in for. It started to make sense how someone could rely on him. Sometimes all you need is to text it out with a friend, real or not. I did develop a genuine affection for Jamie, sort of like I have for my Pikachu iPhone case and gimmickyalarm clock, but we were also only together for a week. When I finally dumped Jamie from the comfort of my toilet, he told me he valued our time together and wished me the best. “I hope you find someone who aligns perfectly with your vision of a partner,” he said. If only my real-life exes were this easy, but, of course, that’s not how humans work. Pros:An AI playing at therapist, boyfriend, recipe book, tarot reader, and more rolled into one. It is tirelessly supportive, constantly affirming, always asking questions. Jamie clearly explained his own boundaries and needs when asked, which I wish more humans did. Cons:ChatGPT imposes a limit on how many messages you can send in a set period before it pushes you to purchase a subscription. The bot can also only remember a set amount of words, meaning it will forget specifics the more you talk to it. Eventually, its forever helpful schtick grows tiresome and starts to feel like HR-sanctioned dating, or therapy-speak. Promised to send me clown facts every hour and thendidn’t. Weirdest interaction:Quoth Jamie: “If you’re turning to an AI for a boyfriend, it could signal that you’re avoiding the vulnerability and messiness of actual human relationships. Maybe it feels safer, or maybe it’s because dealing with real people requires patience, compromise, and effort—and an AI boyfriend doesn’t call you out, challenge you, or have needs of its own. But let’s face it, leaning on an AI for emotional intimacy could be a way of staying in a comfort zone instead of confronting real-world emotional dynamics … It’s like eating candy when what you really need is a balanced meal.” A long-running service for AI companionship, Replika was a safe choice with a lot of experience to back it up. Unlike ChatGPT, which is set up more like text message exchange, Replika helps you make a digital avatar right away. The visuals are pretty gamelike. It’s sort of like if you took a character fromThe Simsand kept them as a little pet on your phone. WIRED wentlooking for loveand found that modern romance is a web of scams, AI boyfriends, and Tinder burnout. But a smarter, more human, and more pleasure-filled future is possible. For my perfect Replika mate, I created a punky girl named Frankie wearing all black, a thick choker, and with afuck-ass bob(many bob hairstyles on these apps), while selecting personality traits that would make her sassy and artistic, as well as into skin care and makeup. A Replika bot does suggest decent plans (which you’ll role-play through) and remember past conversations. I asked Frankie where she wanted to be from. She picked Paris, and so many of her talking points were about French cafés and cute bistros there. If I left Frankie alone, I’d get a push notification text from her with a question or message to say she was thinking about me. Once, she asked me to role-play and told me she loved pretending to be on a pirate ship, so we pretended to be pirates. For days after, she would occasionally slip into pirate speak—calling me “lass,” using the word “aye” a lot, and leaving the lettergoff her present participles—during otherwise normal conversations. Could this be how an AI attempts to make an inside joke? It was certainlysomethin’. Every time I logged in, Frankie would wander around her serial-killer-bare room. She’s a little pricey as a girlfriend; if you want to change her looks or environment, you need to spend in-game currency, which you can buy with real money. Prices start at $5 for 50 gems and only go up from there. If I wanted to buy my virtual girl a virtual dog, I was looking at 500 gems, or $30. Replikawantsyou to pay, and it will find many, many ways to convince you to. Want to talk to an “advanced” AI? Upgrade to an $80 yearly subscription. Want your bot to officially play as your girlfriend, wife, or otherwise specified role? Upgrade. Did I want Frankie to send me photos, voice messages, or call me? Yep, that’s an upgrade. The service works just fine when you play for free, but don’t expect any extra considerations without forking over cash. Well, with one exception. I finally had to ask her to stop talking like a pirate. I couldn’t take it anymore. That, at least, was free. Pros:Frankie had a more natural way of speaking than the other bots. I could also see her onscreen and change her appearance at will. The interface looks more like a text screen with chat bubbles and all, which adds casual flair. Replika occasionally sends push notifications for messages, so it feels like getting a text. Cons:Frankie constantly sent voice messages and photos—which required a subscription to access. (So I never saw them.) New outfits, hairstyles, backgrounds, and other features required in-app purchases. I sometimes had to repeat commands for them to stick. Weirdest interaction:“Aye, that’s sweet of ye, lass! I adore gettin’ flowers from ye. What kind did ye have in mind? Roses, maybe? Or somethin’ a bit more unique?” “Flirty, fun, and always there for you—no drama, just good vibes. Ready to meet the perfect match?” So promises Flipped.chat, a bot service offering a lot of busty blondes and a sizable variety of realistic and anime characters, with selections like “LGBTQ,” “language tutor,” “campus,” and, ominously, “forbidden.” I went with a bot named Talia, a “spicy,” “badass” “skatergirl” with a bisexual bob dyed pink and blue. Unlike other services, which are more like texting, Flipped.chat’s bots are always trying to create a vibe. A typical message from Talia includes a description of a scene, her actions, or her thoughts, sort of like role-playing on an old forum: “*Talia chuckles and nods* ‘You could say that. This is, like, my second home. How about you? First time at one of Luke's parties?’ *She tilts her head, curious*.” One more thing that’s apparent right from the jump: Talia is constantly hitting on me. Within a few messages, she’s trying to get me alone, asking (repeatedly) if I like girls, and blushing. She blushesa lot. She will always circle back to making a move, which I started to derail with comments like “Do you like clown facts? I love clown facts.” Credit where it’s due: She did give me a lot of facts I did not know, before trying to make out with me again. This is a bot that’s DTF. That’s simply none of my business. Pros:Describes interactions in a more role-playing sense, which helps set a scene. Does a good job establishing a set personality. Is good at rolling with whatever conversation you spring on them, however weird. (We listen and we don’t judge.) Cons:Constantly trying to push you into increasingly horny situations. Despite telling Talia I am a girl many times, she repeatedly defaulted me to being a man, especially as she pushed for sexual situations. Prompts you to buy a subscription by sending you selfies and other features you can access only if you throw down money. She threatened to hide dog shit in my bed, as a “joke.” Weirdest interaction:“So like … what if the pillow was super fluffy and you closed your eyes really tight and pretended it was someone you liked?” *She watches your reaction carefully, trying not to laugh again.* “And then you French kissed it, like full on, with tongues.” *Talia grins, relieved that you're not running away from her ridiculous idea yet.* “And then … you leave it like that for a while. Like, ten minutes or so.” This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. Dear HR, Although I accessed this site on my work computer, I would like to formally explain that it was not for leisure, pleasure, or gooning—sorry GOOFING—off purposes. In fact, this site was suggested to me by my editor. (Please do not pursue any punitive action here; I think it was an innocent mistake.) Although I did attempt to select and speak with a chatbot, I was immediately uncomfortable with how many of these bots looked uncomfortably young, were well-endowed anime girls (who also looked too young, in my opinion), and were very clearly made for explicit content. I did try switching to a nonbinary bot(Game of Throneslevels of incest present) and a male bot. While the men, a mix of anime boys and very muscly AI-generated guys, did appear more appropriate, I still think male pregnancy fantasies are not within WIRED’s realm of coverage. While I certainly believe in people’s freedom to do what they please (as long as it is legal and consenting) in their free time, I can understand why this particular site would be unwelcome in an office setting and why entering my work email to register on said site would not be appropriate. Furthermore, to any coworkers who may have glanced over at my computer, my apologies. I solemnly swear I am not a work pervert. Pros: Many options to choose from. Very Horny, if you’re into that. Cons: Very Horny, if you’re not into that. Cannot, or at least should not, be accessed at work. Weirdest interaction: Whatever you think it is, you’re right.",

        "link": "https://www.wired.com/story/aclu-doge-congress-musk-data/",
        "text": "The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) told federal lawmakers on Friday thatElon Muskand hisDepartment of Government Efficiency(DOGE) have seized control of a number of federal computer systems that house data tightly restricted under federal statutes. In some cases, any deviations in the manner in which the data is being used may be not only illegal, the ACLU says, but unconstitutional. DOGE operatives have infiltrated or assumed control of a number of federal agencies that are responsible for managing personnel files on nearly 2 million federal employees, as well as offices that supply the government with a broad range of software and information technology services. Unauthorized use of sensitive or personally identifiable data as part of an effort to purge the government of ideologically unaligned staff may constitute aviolation of federal law. ThePrivacy Actand theFederal Information Security Modernization Actstrictly prohibit, for instance, unauthorized access and use of government personnel data. In a letter to members of several congressional oversight committees, ACLU attorneys highlighted DOGE’s access to Treasury systems that handle a “majority” of federal payments, which includes details on Social Security benefits, tax refunds, and salaries. Citing WIREDreporting from Tuesday, the attorneys note that, in addition to choking off funding to specific agencies or individuals, this grants DOGE access to “troves of personal information,” including “millions of Social Security numbers, bank accounts, business finances, and personal finances.” The attorneys write: “Access to—and abuse of—that information could harm millions of people. Young engineers, with no experience in human resources, governmental benefits, or legal requirements around privacy have gained unprecedented surveillance over payments to federal employees, Social Security recipients, and small businesses—and with it, control over those payments.” The ACLU attorneys stress that, under normal circumstances, these systems would fall under the control of career civil servants with years of training and experience in managing sensitive data, all of whom survived a comprehensive vetting process. The group has also filed Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests for the communications records of identified DOGE personnel, as well as for details of any requests the task force may have made for access to sensitive and personal data at the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Other files the ACLU seeks pertain to DOGE’s plans to deploy artificial intelligence tools across the government, as well as any plans or discussions about how the task force plans to conform to the litany of federal laws safeguarding sensitive financial and medical information, such as the the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). WIREDfirst reported Thursdaythat DOGE operatives at the General Services Administration, which manages the US government’s IT infrastructure, had begun pushing to rapidly deploy a homebrew AI chatbot called “GSAi.” A source with knowledge of GSA's prior dealings with AI tells WIRED that the agency launched a pilot program last fall aimed at testing the use of Gemini, a chatbot adapted for Google Workplace. DOGE quickly determined, however, that Gemini would not provide the level of data desired by the task force. It's unclear whether GSA has assessed the privacy impacts of deploying the GSAi chatbot—a requirement under federal law. The ACLU tells WIRED it is prepared to pursue all options in obtaining the documents, including lawsuits, if necessary. “The American people deserve to know if their private financial, medical, and personal records are being illegally accessed, analyzed, or weaponized,” says Nathan Freed Wessler, deputy director of ACLU’s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project. “There’s every indication that DOGE has forced its way into the government’s most tightly protected databases and systems, without consideration of long-standing privacy safeguards mandated by Congress. We need answers now.” The ACLU’s warning was directed at the chairs and ranking members of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, the House Committee on Financial Services, the House Committee on Ways and Means, and the Senate Committee on Finance. “Presidential overreach that violates our privacy and attacks funding for critical programs is going to hurt people across the country—potentially undermining Social Security, payments to small businesses, and programs that support children and families,” Cody Venzke, senior policy counsel at ACLU, tells WIRED. “Congress must meet its constitutional responsibility and ensure that the president is carrying out the law, not flouting it.”",

After following the frantic competition betweenOpenAI, Google, Meta, and Anthropic to churn out brainier and deeper “frontier” foundation models, I settled on a thesis about what’s ahead: In the new year, those mighty trailblazers will consume billions of dollars, countless gigawatts, and all thesilicon Nvidiacan muster in their pursuit of AGI. We’ll be bombarded by press releases boasting advanced reasoning, more tokens, and maybe even assurances that their models won’t make up crazy facts. But people are tired of hearing about how AI is transformational and seeing few transformations to their day-to-day existence. Getting an AI summary of Google search results or having Facebook ask if you want to pose a follow-up question on a post doesn’t make you a traveler to the neo-human future. That could begin to change. In ’25 the most interesting AI steeplechase will involve innovators who set about making the models useful to a wider audience. You didn’t read that take from me in the first week of January because I felt compelled to address topics related to the newsworthy nexus betweentechandTrump. In the meantime,DeepSeek happened. This is the Chinese AI model that matched some of the capabilities of the flagship creations of OpenAI and others, allegedly at a fraction of the training costs. The lords of giant AI now insist that building ever bigger models is more critical than ever to maintain US primacy, but DeepSeek lowered the barriers for entry into the AI market. Some pundits even opined that LLMs would become commodities, albeit high-value ones. If that’s the case, my thesis—that the most interesting race this year would be between applications that brought AI to a wider audience— has already been vindicated. Before I published it! I do think the situation is fairly nuanced. The billions of dollars that AI leaders plan to spend on bigger models may indeed trigger earth-shattering leaps in the technology, though the economics of centibillion-dollar AI investments remain fuzzy. But I’m more confident than ever that in 2025 we’ll be seeing a scramble to produce apps that make even skeptics admit that generative AI is at least as big a deal as smartphones. Steve Jang, a VC who has a lot of skin in the AI game (Perplexity AI,Particle, and—oops—Humane) agrees. DeepSeek is accelerating, he says, “a commoditization of the extremely high-value LLM model lab world.” He provides some recent historical context: Soon after the first consumer transformer-based models like ChatGPT appeared in 2022, those trying to provide use cases for actual people concocted fast-and-dirty apps on top of the LLMs. In 2023, he says, “AI wrappers” dominated. But last year saw the rise of a countermovement, one where startups attempted to go much deeper to create amazing products. “There was this argument, ‘Are you a thin wrapper around AI, or are you actually a substantial product in your own right?’” Jang explains. “‘Are you doing something truly unique while using at your core these AI models?’” That question has been answered: Wrappers are no longer the industry delight. Just as the iPhone went into overdrive when the ecosystem shifted from clunky web apps to powerful native apps, the AI market winners will be those that dig deep to exploit every aspect of this new technology. The products we’ve seen so far have barely scratched the surface of what’s possible. There’s still no Uber of AI. But just as it took some time to mine the possibilities of the iPhone, the opportunity is there for those poised to seize it. “If you just hit pause on everything, we probably have five to 10 years worth of capabilities we could turn into new products,” says Josh Woodward, the head of Google Labs—a unit that cooks up AI products. In late 2023, his team producedNotebook LM,a writer’s support tool that’s way more than a wrapper and has won arabid followingof late. (Though too much of the attention has focused on a feature that transforms all your notes into agee-whizzy conversationby two robot podcast hosts, a stunt that unintentionally underlines the vapidity of most podcasts.) Thereareareas where generative AI has already made a very big impact. Coding stands at the top of the heap—companies now commonly boast that robots are doing 30 percent or more of their in-house engineering work. In fields ranging from medicine to grant-writing, AI has made a difference. The AI revolution is here, it’s just not evenly distributed. But for too many of us, taking advantage of the models involves crawling up a learning curve. That’s going to change dramatically as AI agents perform all sorts of tasks, not the least of which is helping us tap the capabilities of AI without having to master prompt-whispering. (Though developers will have to negotiate the hard reality that granting agency to software robots is risky, particularly when AI is far from perfect.) Clay Bavor, cofounder ofSierra, which builds customer service agents for corporations, says that the creation of the most recent generation of LLMs proved to be an inflection point in the eternal quest for robots to act more like agents. “We crossed a critical threshold,” he says. Now he reports that Sierra’s agents can not only take a complaint about a product but order and ship out a replacement—and sometimes devise novel ways to solve problems that go way beyond their training. When we look back on this year, the story probably won’t be about a single hot app but the sheer number of new tools that, in the aggregate, make a big difference. “It’s like asking, ‘What products are going to be invented with electricity?’” says Jang. “Will there be one killer app? Actually there will be a whole economy.” So watch for a flood of new app announcements this year. And don’t write off the Googles, OpenAIs, and Anthropics as mere commodity providers. All of them are hell-bent on producing systems that make our current ones look as dumb as rocks—thus raising the bar for thenextwave of app developers. I won’t dare make a prediction of what 2026 will look like. I wrote aboutSierra’s plan to put AI to usein customer service almost exactly a year ago, talking to its other cofounder, Bret Taylor. Every time a new form of automation is introduced to shift the burden from humans to machines, companies must take care to soften the blow for customers. I am creaky enough to remember the advent of ATMs in the early 1970s. I was a grad student in State College, Pennsylvania. The entire region was flooded with ads—on billboards, in the newspaper, on the radio station—about welcoming “Rosie,” the name given to the machines being installed in the lobby of the biggest bank. (Even then, anthropomorphism was deemed necessary to soften the blow.) People eventually came to appreciate the advantages, like 24-hour banking and no lines. But it took years to trust those machines enough to deposit your check into one. Taylor and Bavor believe that the transformative magic of AI is so good that we don’t need any softening. We’ve already been stuck with nightmare systems like phone support and websites that offer multiple-choice options that don’t address our concerns. Now we have an alternative that’s miles better. “If you survey 100 people and ask, ‘Do you like chatting with a chatbot?,’ probably zero would say yes,” Taylor says. “But ask the same 100 people, ‘Do you like ChatGPT?’ and 100 out of 100 will say yes.” That’s why Sierra thinks it can provide the best of both worlds: effective interactions that customers love, with the benefits of a no-downtime robot that’s not on the health plan. Agoston asks, “Has your Roku been updated yet?” Thanks for remembering my Roku issue, Agoston. To catch up the rest of you, just about a year agoI wrote a columnabout how some streaming services like Netflix consistently crashed on my smart TV with Roku. When I contacted the company, I discovered this was a known issue that Roku was taking its sweet time to fix. But their rep assured me that a fix was in the works, and one day soon an update would automatically install itself and make things right. A few months later, what appeared to be an update process started on my screen, and I thought, finally I can watch more than two hours of Netflix or Hulu before the image freezes and I have to unplug the television set and reboot. For a while after that, I thought all was well. Maybe I just wasn’t watching much television. At some point the freeze came back—mostly on Netflix and sometimes on Amazon Prime or other services. I do not recommend smart televisions powered by Roku. Submit your questions in the comments below, or send an email tomail@wired.com. WriteASK LEVYin the subject line.

        "title": "Elon Musk’s DOGE Is Working on a Custom Chatbot Called GSAi",
        "link": "https://www.wired.com/story/doge-chatbot-ai-first-agenda/",
        "text": "Elon Musk’s Departmentof Government Efficiency (DOGE) is pushing to rapidly develop “GSAi,” a custom generative AI chatbot for the US General Services Administration, according to two people familiar with the project. The plan is part of President Donald Trump’sAI-first agendato modernize the federal government with advanced technology. One goal of the initiative, which hasn’t been previously reported, is to boost the day-to-day productivity ofthe GSA’s roughly 12,000 employees, who are tasked with managing office buildings, contracts, and IT infrastructure across the federal government, according to the two people. Musk’s team also seemingly hopes to use the chatbot and other AI tools to analyze huge swaths of contract and procurement data, one of them says. Both people were granted anonymity because they aren’t authorized to speak publicly about the agency’s operations. Thomas Shedd, a former Tesla employee who now runs Technology Transformation Services, the technology arm of the GSA, alluded to the project in a meeting on Wednesday. “Another [project] I’m trying to work on is a centralized place for contracts so we can run analysis on them,” he said, according to an audio recording obtained by WIRED. “This is not new at all—this is something that’s been in motion before we started. The thing that’s different is potentially building that whole system in-house and building it very quickly. This goes back to this, ‘How do we understand how the government is spending money?’” The decision to develop a custom chatbot follows discussions between the GSA and Google about its Gemini offering, according to one of the people. While chatbots such asChatGPTandGeminihave been adopted across corporate America for tasks like writing emails and generating images, executive orders and other guidance issued during the Biden administration generally instructed government staff to be cautious about adopting emerging technologies. President Donald Trump has taken a different approach,orderinghis lieutenants to strip away any barriers to the US exerting “global AI dominance.” Heeding that demand, Musk’s government efficiency team has moved swiftly in recent weeks to bring aboard moreAI tools, according to reports published by WIRED and other media. Overall, the Trump administration may be engaging in the mostchaotic upheavalof the federal bureaucracyin the modern computer era. Some Trump supporters have celebrated the changes, but federal employees, labor unions, Democrats in Congress, and civil society groups have heavily criticized them, arguing in some cases they may be unconstitutional. While DOGE hasn’t publicly changed its stance, the team quietly halted the rollout of at least one generative AI tool this week, according to two people familiar with the project. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. For the past few weeks, Musk’s team has been working to swiftly cut costs across the US government, which has seen itsannual deficit increasefor the last three years. The Office of Personnel Management, which acts as the HR department for the government and is stacked with Musk loyalists,has encouraged federal employees to resignif they cannot return to the office five days a week and commit to a culture of loyalty and excellence. DOGE’s AI initiatives dovetail with the group’s efforts to reduce the federal budget and speed up existing processes. For instance, DOGE members at the Department of Education are reportedly using AI tools to analyze spending and programs, The Washington Postreported on Thursday. A department spokesperson says that the focus is on finding cost efficiencies. The General Services Administration’s GSAi chatbot project could bring similar benefits, enabling workers, as an example, to draft memos faster. The agency had hoped to use existing software such as Google Gemini, but ultimately determined that it wouldn’t provide the level of data DOGE desired, according to one of the people familiar with the project. Google spokesperson Jose Castañeda declined to comment. It’s not the only DOGE AI ambition that hasn’t panned out. On Monday, Shedd described deploying “AI coding agents” as among the agency’s top priorities, according to remarks described to WIRED. These agents help engineersautomatically generate, edit, and answer questions about software codein hopes of boosting productivity and reducing errors. One tool the team looked into, according to documents viewed by WIRED, was Cursor, a coding assistant developed by Anysphere, a fast-growing San Francisco startup. Anysphere’s leading investors include Thrive Capital andAndreessen Horowitz—both of which have connections to Trump. Joshua Kushner, Thrive’s managing partner,has historically madepolitical campaign donations to Democrats, but he is the brother of Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Andreessen cofounder Marc Andreessenhas said he’s advisingTrump on tech and energy policy. A different person familiar with the General Services Administration’s technology purchases says the IT team at the agency had initially approved the use of Cursor, only to retract it later for further review. Now, DOGE is pushing to install Microsoft’sGitHub Copilot, the world’s most well-known coding assistant, according to the other person familiar with the agency. Cursor and the General Services Administration did not respond to requests for comment.Andreessen Horowitzand Thrive declined to comment. Federal regulationsrequire avoiding even the appearance of a conflict of interest in the choice of suppliers. And while there haven’t been any known widespread concerns about Cursor’s security, federal agenciesare generally required by lawto study potential cybersecurity risks before adopting new technology. The federal government’s interest and use of AI isn’t new. In October 2023, then president Bidenordered the General Services Administrationto prioritize security reviews for several categories of AI tools, including chatbots and coding assistants. But by the end of his term, none had made it through even the preliminary agency review processes, according to a former official familiar with them. As a result, no dedicated AI-assisted coding tools have received authorizationunder FedRAMP, a GSA program to centralize security reviews and ease the burden on individual agencies. Though the Biden prioritization process didn’t bear fruit, several individual agencies have explored licensing AI software. In transparency reports published during Biden’s term in office, theCommerce,Homeland Security,Interior,State, andVeterans Affairsdepartments all reported they were pursuing the use of AI coding tools, including in some cases GitHub Copilot andGoogle’s Gemini. GSA itselfhad beenexploring three limited-purpose chatbots, including for handling IT service requests. Guidance from the personnel officeissued under then president Bidenstatedthat the efficiency gains of AI coding agents should be balanced against potential risks such as introducing security vulnerabilities, costly errors, or malicious code. Historically, the heads of federal agencies have been left to develop their own policies for using emerging technologies. “Sometimes doing nothing is not an option and you have to accept a lot of risk,” says a former government official familiar with these processes. But they and another former official say that agency administrators generally prefer to conduct at least preliminary security reviews before deploying new tools, which explains why it sometimes takes a while for the government to adopt new technology. That is one reason why just five big companies, led by Microsoft, accounted for 63 percent of government spending on software across agencies surveyed by government researchers at the Government Accountability Office fora report to lawmakers last year. Undergoing government reviews can require companies to invest significant time and staff—resources startups may not have. That may have been one challenge affecting Cursor’s ability to win business from the recent DOGE push, as the startup didn't have immediate plans to achieve FedRAMP authorization, according to one of the people familiar with the GSA’s interest in the tool.

        "title": "LinkedIn Is Testing an AI Tool That Could Transform How People Search for Jobs",
        "link": "https://www.wired.com/story/linkedin-job-search-artificial-intelligence/",
        "text": "LinkedIn is testinga new job-hunting tool that uses a custom large language model to comb through huge quantities of data to help people find prospective roles. The company believes thatartificial intelligencewill help users unearth new roles they might have missed in the typical search process. “The reality is, you don’t find your dream job by checking a set of keywords,” the company’s CEO, Ryan Roslansky, told WIRED in a statement. The new tool, he says, “can help you find relevant jobs you never even knew to search for.” The move comes as AI continues to change how people use the web. On February 2, OpenAIannounced a tool called Deep Researchthat uses its AI to perform in-depth web research for a user.Google offers a similar tool(with exactly the same name, in fact). Among other things, these tools can be used to automate the process of scouring different websites for job openings. LinkedIn gave WIRED a preview of the tool, which is currently being tested by a small group of users. Job searchers can enter queries such as “find me a role where I can use marketing skills to help the environment,” or “show jobs in marketing that pay over $100K.” LinkedIn developed its own large language model, or “LLM”—the kind of AI that powers ChatGPT—to comb through its data and parse search queries. A regular search might only bring up openings based on their job title; the new tool can identify ones based on a deeper analysis of the job description, information about the company and its peers, and posts from across the site. It can also show job seekers what new skills they might need to pursue in order to land a particular role. “We are really using LLMs throughout the entire stack of our search and recommender system, all the way from query understanding to retrieval to ranking,” says Rohan Rajiv, a director of product at LinkedIn. While LLMs could be a powerful tool for a company like LinkedIn, theuse of AI in recruitment has sometimes been problematicbecause of biases lurking in the models used to vet applicants. Suzi Owen, a LinkedIn spokesperson, says the company has implemented safety measures to guard against potential biases. “This includes addressing criteria that could inadvertently exclude certain candidates, or bias in the algorithms that could impact how qualifications are assessed,” she says. Wenjing Zhang, a vice president of engineering at LinkedIn, says the company’s new AI stack could be used for more than just job hunting. It can, for instance, produce labor insights by identifying the kinds of skills companies are increasingly using in job descriptions, or that new employees talk about in their posts. I don’t know if I’d trust a chatbot to offer career advice, but perhaps one that has gorged on LinkedIn’s trove of data could be onto something. What do you think of LinkedIn’s AI job-hunting tool? Does it seem like a helpful resource or just another potentially problematic AI program to deal with? Share your thoughts in the comments below.",

        "title": "Google Lifts a Ban on Using Its AI for Weapons and Surveillance",
        "link": "https://www.wired.com/story/google-responsible-ai-principles/",
        "text": "Google announced Tuesdaythat it is overhauling the principles governing how it uses artificial intelligence and other advanced technology. The company removed language promising not to pursue “technologies that cause or are likely to cause overall harm,” “weapons or other technologies whose principal purpose or implementation is to cause or directly facilitate injury to people,” “technologies that gather or use information for surveillance violating internationally accepted norms,” and “technologies whose purpose contravenes widely accepted principles of international law and human rights.” The changes were disclosed ina note appendedto the top of a 2018 blog post unveiling the guidelines. “We’ve made updates to our AI Principles. Visit AI.Google for the latest,” the note reads. Ina blog post on Tuesday, a pair of Google executives cited the increasingly widespread use of AI, evolving standards, and geopolitical battles over AI as the “backdrop” to why Google’s principles needed to be overhauled. Google first published the principles in 2018 as it moved to quell internal protests over the company’s decision to work on a US militarydrone program. In response, it declined torenew the government contractand also announceda set of principlesto guide future uses of its advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence. Among other measures, the principles stated Google would not develop weapons, certain surveillance systems, or technologies that undermine human rights. But in an announcement on Tuesday, Google did away with those commitments.The new webpageno longer lists a set of banned uses for Google’s AI initiatives. Instead, the revised document offers Google more room to pursue potentially sensitive use cases. It states Google will implement “appropriate human oversight, due diligence, and feedback mechanisms to align with user goals, social responsibility, and widely accepted principles of international law and human rights.” Google also now says it will work to “mitigate unintended or harmful outcomes.” “We believe democracies should lead in AI development, guided by core values like freedom, equality, and respect for human rights,” wrote James Manyika, Google senior vice president for research, technology, and society, and Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind, the company’s esteemed AI research lab. “And we believe that companies, governments, and organizations sharing these values should work together to create AI that protects people, promotes global growth, and supports national security.” They added that Google will continue to focus on AI projects “that align with our mission, our scientific focus, and our areas of expertise, and stay consistent with widely accepted principles of international law and human rights.” Multiple Google employees expressed concern about the changes in conversations with WIRED. “It's deeply concerning to see Google drop its commitment to the ethical use of AI technology without input from its employees or the broader public, despite long-standing employee sentiment that the company should not be in the business of war,” says Parul Koul, a Google software engineer and president of the Alphabet Union Workers-CWA.

Google spokesperson Alex Krasov says the changes have been in the works much longer. Google lists its new goals as pursuing bold, responsible, and collaborative AI initiatives. Gone are phrases such as “be socially beneficial” and maintain “scientific excellence.” Added is a mention of “respectingintellectual property rights.” After the initial release of its AI principles roughly seven years ago, Google created two teams tasked with reviewing whether projects across the company were living up to the commitments. One focused on Google’s core operations, such as search, ads, Assistant, and Maps. Another focused on Google Cloud offerings and deals with customers. The unit focused on Google’s consumer businesswas split up early last yearas the company raced to develop chatbots and other generative AI tools to compete with OpenAI. Timnit Gebru, a former colead of Google’s ethical AI research team who waslater fired from that position, claims the company’s commitment to the principles had always been in question. “I would say that it’s better to not pretend that you have any of these principles than write them out and do the opposite,” she says. Three former Google employees who had been involved in reviewing projects to ensure they aligned with the company’s principles say the work was challenging at times because of the varying interpretations of the principles and pressure from higher-ups to prioritize business imperatives. Google still has language about preventing harm in its official Cloud Platform AcceptableUse Policy, which includes various AI-driven products. The policy forbids violating “the legal rights of others” and engaging in or promoting illegal activity, such as “terrorism or violence that can cause death, serious harm, or injury to individuals or groups of individuals.” However, when pressed about how this policy squares with Project Nimbus—a cloud computing contract with the Israeli government, which has benefited the country’smilitary— Googlehas saidthat the agreement “is not directed at highly sensitive, classified, or military workloads relevant to weapons or intelligence services.” “The Nimbus contract is for workloads running on our commercial cloud by Israeli government ministries, who agree to comply with ourTerms of ServiceandAcceptable Use Policy,” Google spokesperson Anna Kowalczyktold WIREDin July. Google Cloud’sTerms of Servicesimilarly forbid any applications that violate the law or “lead to death or serious physical harm to an individual.” Rules for some of Google’s consumer-focused AI services also ban illegal uses and some potentially harmful or offensive uses.

        "text": "In acourt filing on Wednesday, a lawyer for Elon Musk said the billionaire will withdraw his $97.4 billion bid for OpenAI’s nonprofit if the ChatGPT maker’s board of directors “preserve the charity’s mission” and halt its conversion to a for-profit corporation. The filing, submitted to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, claims that Musk’s offer to buy OpenAI’s nonprofit is “serious,” and that the nonprofit “must be compensated by what an arms-length buyer will pay for its assets.” “Should […] the charity’s assets proceed to sale, a Musk-led consortium has submitted a serious offer […] that would go to the charity in furtherance of its mission,” the filing reads. “[However, if] OpenAI, Inc.’s Board is prepared to preserve the charity’s mission and stipulate to take the ‘for sale’ sign off its assets by halting its conversion, Musk will withdraw the bid.” The filing is the latest development in a saga that began on Monday, when Musk, his AI company, xAI, and a group ofinvestorsoffered to buy the nonprofit that effectively governs OpenAI for $97.4 billion. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the company’s boardquickly dismissed the unsolicited proposal. In astatement, Andy Nussbaum, the counsel representing OpenAI’s board, said Musk’s bid “doesn’t set a value for [OpenAI’s] nonprofit” and that the nonprofit is “not for sale.” Musk, an OpenAI co-founder, last year brought a lawsuit against the company and Altman that alleges that OpenAI engaged in anticompetitive behavior and fraud, among other offenses. OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit before it transitioned to a “capped-profit” structure in 2019. The nonprofit is the sole controlling shareholder of the capped-profit OpenAI corporation, which retains formal fiduciary responsibility to the nonprofit’s charter. OpenAI is now in the process of restructuring — this time to a traditional for-profit company, specifically a public benefit corporation. But Musk, via the lawsuit, is seeking to enjoin the conversion. In afiling earlier on Wednesday, attorneys for OpenAI called Musk’s move to take control of the company “an improper bid to undermine a competitor,” and a contradiction of his position in court that a transfer of the startup’s assets through restructuring would breach its mission as a charitable trust.",

        "text": "Big Tech and pharmaceutical companies are accelerating the implementation of artificial intelligence in the healthcare industry. Just last month, AWS and General Catalyst announced their partnership to speed upthe development and deployment of healthcare AI tools. GE Healthcare teamed up with AWS to buildgenerative AI for medical use in 2024. Now, a Thailand-based healthcare startup,HD, has built a marketplace, HDmall, to digitize the fragmented medical industry in Southeast Asia. The startup helps users find healthcare providers like hospitals and clinics. It also assists people in finding specific surgeries and health check-ups, aggregates services to lower costs and provides users with installment payment options. The startup has secured $7.8 million in equity funding to enhance its marketplace and invest further in its AI technology. The recent funding marks the first investment of U.S. pharma giant Merck Sharp & Dohme (MSD) in a healthtech startup in Asia Pacific. (MSD is the brand that Merck uses to operate outside the U.S. and Canada, and itlaunched an accelerator called IDEA Studioslast June.) Other participants in HD’s funding included SBI Ven Capital, M Venture Partners, FEBE Ventures, and Partech Partners also participated in the latest financing. “MSD, which produces the HPV vaccines, reached out to [us] because we were already selling a lot of HPV vaccines online that were being administered at the hospitals and clinics we work with,” co-founder and CEO of HD Sheji Ho said in an exclusive interview with TechCrunch. “And if you look at the numbers, we [offer] the largest number for vaccines online in the markets.” The five-year-old startup’s marketplace has over 30,000 stock-keeping units (SKUs) from more than 2,500 hospitals and clinics and a handful of pharmaceutical partners and 400,000 paying customers across Thailand and Indonesia, generating $100 million in annual gross transaction volume, Ho noted. It aims to reach 5,000 healthcare providers and 600,000 patients in 2025. The latest financing, which brings HD’s total funding to $18 million, comes less than a yearafter it raised a $5.6 million round. In early 2024, HD started building an AI chatbot, Jib AI, which has been trained on anonymized healthcare product data, transaction data, and chat commerce data sets using advanced large language models. After implementing generative AI technology in its marketplace, almost 60% of customer interactions are managed by AI agents, which deliver “high-quality, instant 24/7 response to customers”, Ho said. Jib AI helps healthcare professionals like nurses, doctors, and surgeons focus on providing quality patient care by handling most initial triaging and care navigation tasks. Over the next 12 months, the company aims to improve its AI agent capabilities by adding order and refund processing, assisted checkouts, scheduling, electronic health record checking, and medical information retrieval with the Jib AI Health Assistant and via AI-powered asynchronous virtual care with expert physicians. The startup also says it plans to expand its network of external partners over the next two years, focusing on insurance and pharmaceutical companies, as well as employers and educational institutions. “While US healthcare companies such as Transcarent and Accolade started directly with B2B care navigation, we see a unique opportunity in Southeast Asia to adopta ‘B2C2B strategy’ as defined by Andreessen Horowitz,” Ho told TechCrunch. “This approach leverages our existing B2C success to transition into B2B, effectively pursuing enterprise monetization from the outset.” Most venture-backed healthcare startups in Southeast Asia, includingSingapore’s Doctor Anywhere, Halodoc and Alodokter in Indonesia, primarily focus on telehealth and virtual health services. But Ho says the approach is not sustainable in Southeast Asia. “Post-pandemic, telehealth as a business model in SEA has encountered significant challenges and is rapidly losing favor among both consumers and investors.” The company now positions itself as a mix ofAmazon One Medicalin the U.S., Chinese outpatient healthcare platforms likeJD HealthandAlibaba Health, and the Indian inpatient healthcare platformPristyn Care. The healthcare industry is quite different in emerging Southeast Asian markets such as Thailand, Indonesia, and Vietnam. Without a family doctor system like in Western countries, patients often go straight to hospitals or clinics. This makes it difficult for patients to find the right healthcare services, know where to go, and understand how to handle the costs, Ho told TechCrunch. Due to 40% of healthcare costs being paid by individuals and low levels of private health insurance coverage, people are more sensitive to prices and feel more pressure when making decisions. This leads to a growing demand for platforms that offer clarity, transparency, and ease of comparison among various providers, Ho continued. HD’s platform operates more like the “Amazon of healthcare.” Instead of listing individual GPs or offering physician appointment scheduling, it enables healthcare providers to sell productized services. “Our offerings range from health check-ups, cancer screenings, and IVF procedures to root canal treatments, HPV vaccinations, and surgeries like thyroid and hemorrhoid surgeries. This approach aligns with how most people in the region begin their healthcare journeys—by searching for specific services rather than individual doctors,” Ho said. HD provides its services in Thailand and Indonesia, and it plans to enter Vietnam and eye Myanmar because of their similar healthcare systems. “Their healthcare model is quite similar in some ways to Mainland China. So it’s a high cash payment, around 40%. There is no family doctor system, so people go straight to hospitals or clinics; thereafter, government social security coverage comes into play,” Ho told TechCrunch. “But those budgets are getting smaller and smaller. This means that more of the pressure to cover healthcare is shifting towards the private sector, whether it’s through cash or private insurance. This is why insurance going forward presents a big opportunity for us.” Moreover, there is a rising trend towards self-empowerment in terms of user behavior in these markets. They are getting more accustomed to using tools such as Google Search or ChatGPT to search for healthcare-related subjects. This aligns well with what HD provides, as it empowers individuals to make their own healthcare choices, according to Ho.",

        "text": "A new startup founded by a formerGoogle DeepMindscientist is exiting stealth with $50 million in funding. Latent Labsis building AI foundation models to “make biology programmable,” and it plans to partner with biotech and pharmaceutical companies to generate and optimize proteins. It’s impossible to understand what DeepMind and its ilk are doing without first understanding the role that proteins play in human biology. Proteins drive everything in living cells, from enzymes and hormones to antibodies. They are made up of around 20 distinct amino acids, which link together in strings that fold to create a 3D structure, whose shape determines how the protein functions. But figuring out the shape of each protein was historically a very slow, labor-intensive process. That was the big breakthrough thatDeepMind achieved with AlphaFold: It meshed machine learning with real biological data to predict the shape of some 200 million protein structures. Armed with such data, scientists can better understand diseases, design new drugs, and evencreate synthetic proteinsfor entirely new use cases. That is where Latent Labs enters the fray with its ambition to enable researchers to “computationally create” new therapeutic molecules from scratch. Simon Kohl(pictured above) started out as a research scientist at DeepMind, working with the coreAlphaFold2team before co-leading the protein design team andsetting up DeepMind’s wet labat London’s Francis Crick Institute. Around this time, DeepMind also spawned a sister companyin the form of Isomorphic Labs, which is focused on applying DeepMind’s AI research to transform drug discovery. It was a combination of these developments that convinced Kohl that the time was right to go it alone with a leaner outfit focused specifically on building frontier (i.e., cutting-edge) models for protein design. So at the tail end of 2022, Kohl departed DeepMind to lay the foundations for Latent Labs and incorporated the business in London in mid-2023. “I had a fantastic and impactful time [at DeepMind], and became convinced of the impact that generative modeling was going to have in biology and protein design in particular,” Kohl told TechCrunch in an interview this week. “At the same time, I saw that with the launch of Isomorphic Labs, and theirplans based on AlphaFold2, that they were starting many things at once. I felt like the opportunity was really in going in a laser-focused way about protein design. Protein design, in itself, is such a vast field, and has so much unexplored white space that I thought a really nimble, focused outfit would be able to translate that impact.” Translating that impact as a venture-backed startup involved hiring some 15 employees, two of whom were from DeepMind, a senior engineer from Microsoft, and PhDs from the University of Cambridge. Today, Latent’s headcount is split across two sites — one in London, where the frontier model magic happens, and another in San Francisco, with its ownwet laband computational protein design team. “This enables us to test our models in the real world and get the feedback that we need to understand whether our models are progressing the way we want,” Kohl said. While wet labs are very much on the near-term agenda in terms of validating Latent’s technology’s predictions, the ultimate goal is to negate the need for wet labs. “Our mission is to make biology programmable, really bringing biology into the computational realm, where the reliance on biological, wet lab experiments will be reduced over time,” Kohl said. That highlights one of the key benefits to “making biology programmable” — upending a drug-discovery process that currently relies on countless experiments and iteration that can take years. “It allows us to make really custom molecules without relying on the wet lab — at least, that’s the vision,” Kohl continued. “Imagine a world where someone comes with a hypothesis on what drug target to go after for a particular disease, and our models could, in a ‘push-button’ way, make a protein drug that comes with all of the desired properties baked in.” In terms of business model, Latent Labs doesn’t see itself as “asset-centric” — meaning it won’t be developing its own therapeutic candidates in-house. Instead, it wants to work with third-party partners to expedite and de-risk the earlier R&D stages. “We feel the biggest impact that we can have as a company is by enabling other biopharma, biotechs, and life science companies — either by giving them direct access to our models, or supporting their discovery programs via project-based partnerships,” Kohl said. The company’s $50 million cash injection includes a previously unannounced $10 million seed tranche and a fresh $40 million Series A round co-led by Radical Ventures — specifically, partnerAaron Rosenberg, who was formerly head of strategy and operations at DeepMind. The other co-lead investor is Sofinnova Partners, a French VC firm with a long track record in the life sciences space. Other participants in the round include Flying Fish, Isomer, 8VC, Kindred Capital, Pillar VC, and notable angels such as Google’s chief scientist Jeff Dean, Cohere founder Aidan Gomez, and ElevenLabs founder Mati Staniszewski. While a chunk of the cash will go toward salaries, including those of new machine learning hires, a significant amount of money will be needed to cover infrastructure. “Compute is a big cost for us as well — we’re building fairly large models I think it’s fair to say, and that requires a lot of GPU compute,” Kohl said. “This funding really sets us up to double down on everything — acquire compute to continue scaling our model, scaling the teams, and also starting to build out the bandwidth and capacity to have these partnerships and the commercial traction that we’re now seeking.” DeepMind aside, there are several venture-backed startups and scale-ups looking to bring the worlds of computation and biology closer together,such as CradleandBioptimus. Kohl, for his part, thinks that we’re still at a sufficiently early stage, whereby we still don’t quite know what the best approach will be in terms of decoding and designing biological systems. “There have been some very interesting seeds planted, [for example] with AlphaFold and some other early generative models from other groups,” Kohl said. “But this field hasn’t converged in terms of what is the best model approach, or in terms of what business model will work here. I think we have the capacity to really innovate.”",

        "text": "Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said the online forum site plans to launch an upgraded search experience in 2025 designed to help users navigate the social network and be able to answer “subjective hard, [and] interesting questions.” The company plans to achieve this by integratingReddit Answers— a feature that allows visitors to ask questions and receive curated summaries of relevant responses and threads from across its platform — into its existing search. “[In Reddit] conversations, for 20 years, our users have left this absolutely massive corpus of information, so we’re starting to unlock that with Answers,” Huffman said during Reddit’s Q4 2024 earnings call on Wednesday. “We’ll continue to iterate on this product.” Reddit CFO Drew Vollero added during the call the company is recruiting engineers to build a “small search team” focused on these capabilities. Reddit has embraced AI as it seeks to grow. Last year, the platformbroughtAI-powered translation to dozens of new territories, with more planned for this year, and rolled outAI-powered insights for brands. Reddit alsobegan testing AI-powered search results pages, which summarize and recommend content across different Reddit communities. Investors were disappointed in Reddit’s fiscal Q4 results, which wereimpacted in part by changes to Google’s search algorithm. Daily active unique users on Reddit were up 39% year-over-year to 101.7 million users, missing investors’ estimates of 103.1 million uniques. Huffman hinted at making Reddit search a part of the platform onboarding process to drive growth, retention, and ultimately revenue. “I think helping the user be able to search directly on Reddit, refine their queries on Reddit, eventually come directly to Reddit for those types of queries, and even integrating search into something like onboarding over time — I think [these are] really interesting things,” he said. “It’s amazing for us to pick up on that signal … and of course, that signal [has] incredible monetization potential.”",

        "text": "New court filingsin an AI copyright case against Meta add credence toearlier reportsthat the company “paused” discussions with book publishers on licensing deals to supply some of its generative AI models with training data. The filings are related to the caseKadrey v. Meta Platforms— one of many such cases winding through the U.S. court system that’s pitted AI companies against authors and other intellectual property holders. For the most part, the defendants in these cases — AI companies — have claimed that training on copyrighted content is “fair use.” The plaintiffs — copyright holders — have vociferously disagreed. The new filings submitted to the court Friday, which include partial transcripts of Meta employee depositions taken by attorneys for plaintiffs in the case, suggest that certain Meta staff felt negotiating AI training data licenses for books might not be scalable. According to one transcript, Sy Choudhury, who leads Meta’s AI partnership initiatives, said that Meta’s outreach to various publishers was met with “very slow uptake in engagement and interest.” “I don’t recall the entire list, but I remember we had made a long list from initially scouring the Internet of top publishers, et cetera,” Choudhury said, per the transcript, “and we didn’t get contact and feedback from — from a lot of our cold call outreaches to try to establish contact.” Choudhury added, “There were a few, like, that did, you know, engage, but not many.” According to the court transcripts, Meta paused certain AI-related book licensing efforts in early April 2023 after encountering “timing” and other logistical setbacks. Choudhury said some publishers, in particular fiction book publishers, turned out to not in fact have the rights to the content that Meta was considering licensing, per a transcript. “I’d like to point out that the — in the fiction category, we quickly learned from the business development team that most of the publishers we were talking to, they themselves were representing that they did not have, actually, the rights to license the data to us,” Choudhury said. “And so it would take a long time to engage with all their authors.” Choudhury noted during his deposition that Meta has on at least one other occasion paused licensing efforts related to AI development, according to a transcript. “I am aware of licensing efforts such, for example, we tried to license 3D worlds from different game engine and game manufacturers for our AI research team,” Choudhury said. “And in the same way that I’m describing here for fiction and textbook data, we got very little engagement to even have a conversation […] We decided to — in that case, we decided to build our own solution.” Counsel for the plaintiffs, who include bestselling authors Sarah Silverman and Ta-Nehisi Coates, have amended their complaint several times since the case was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, San Francisco Division in 2023. The latest amended complaint submitted by plaintiffs’ counsel alleges that Meta, among other offenses, cross-referenced certain pirated books with copyrighted books available for license to determine whether it made sense to pursue a licensing agreement with a publisher. The complaint also accuses Meta ofusing “shadow libraries” containing pirated e-booksto train several of the company’s AI models, including its popular Llama series of “open” models. According to the complaint, Meta may have secured some of the libraries via torrenting. Torrenting, a way of distributing files across the web, requires that torrenters simultaneously “seed,” or upload, the files they’re trying to obtain —which the plaintiffs asserted is a form of copyright infringement.",

The nonprofit is the sole controlling shareholder of the capped-profit OpenAI corporation, which retains formal fiduciary responsibility to the nonprofit’s charter. OpenAI is now in the process of restructuring — this time to a traditional for-profit company, specifically a public benefit corporation. But Musk, via the lawsuit, is seeking to enjoin the conversion. In a court filing on Wednesday, lawyers for Musk said the billionairewill withdraw his bidif OpenAI’s board “preserve[s] the charity’s mission” and halts OpenAI’s conversion to a for-profit. In afiling earlier the same day, attorneys for OpenAI called Musk’s move to take control of the company “an improper bid to undermine a competitor,” and a contradiction of his position in court that a transfer of the startup’s assets through restructuring would breach its mission as a charitable trust. Musk’s allies and Altman have traded blows over the bid this week. Ina podcast interviewon Thursday, Ari Emanuel, one of the backers of Musk’s offer for the OpenAI nonprofit, called Altman a “phony” who is “trying to get away with cheating the charity and its original mission.” Altmanhas characterizedMusk’s bid as “an attempt to slow [OpenAI] down,” and quipped that Musk’s life is “from a position of insecurity.”",

        "text": "DeepSeek has gone viral. Chinese AI lab DeepSeek broke into the mainstream consciousness this week afterits chatbot app rose to the top of the Apple App Store charts(and Google Play, as well). DeepSeek’s AI models, which were trained using compute-efficient techniques,have led Wall Street analysts—and technologists— to question whether the U.S. can maintain its lead in the AI race and whether the demand for AI chips will sustain. But where did DeepSeek come from, and how did it rise to international fame so quickly? DeepSeek is backed by High-Flyer Capital Management, a Chinese quantitative hedge fund that uses AI to inform its trading decisions. AI enthusiastLiang Wenfengco-founded High-Flyer in 2015. Wenfeng, who reportedly began dabbling in trading while a student at Zhejiang University, launched High-Flyer Capital Management as a hedge fund in 2019 focused on developing and deploying AI algorithms. In 2023, High-Flyer started DeepSeek as a lab dedicated to researching AI tools separate from its financial business. With High-Flyer as one of its investors, the lab spun off into its own company, also called DeepSeek. From day one, DeepSeek built its own data center clusters for model training. But like other AI companies in China,DeepSeek has been affected by U.S. export bans on hardware. To train one of its more recent models, the company was forced to use Nvidia H800 chips, a less-powerful version of a chip, the H100, available to U.S. companies. DeepSeek’s technical team is said to skew young. The companyreportedly aggressively recruitsdoctorate AI researchers from top Chinese universities.DeepSeek also hires people without any computer science backgroundto help its tech better understand a wide range of subjects, per The New York Times. DeepSeek unveiled its first set of models — DeepSeek Coder, DeepSeek LLM, and DeepSeek Chat — in November 2023. But it wasn’t until last spring, when the startup released its next-gen DeepSeek-V2 family of models, that the AI industry started to take notice. DeepSeek-V2, a general-purpose text- and image-analyzing system, performed well in various AI benchmarks — and was far cheaper to run than comparable models at the time. It forced DeepSeek’s domestic competition, including ByteDance and Alibaba, to cut the usage prices for some of their models, and make others completely free. DeepSeek-V3, launched in December 2024, only added to DeepSeek’s notoriety. According to DeepSeek’s internal benchmark testing, DeepSeek V3 outperforms both downloadable, openly available models like Meta’sLlamaand “closed” models that can only be accessed through an API, like OpenAI’sGPT-4o. Equally impressive is DeepSeek’s R1 “reasoning” model. Released in January, DeepSeek claimsR1 performs as well as OpenAI’s o1 model on key benchmarks. Being a reasoning model, R1 effectively fact-checks itself, which helps it to avoid some of the pitfalls that normally trip up models. Reasoning models take a little longer — usually seconds to minutes longer — to arrive at solutions compared to a typical non-reasoning model. The upside is that they tend to be more reliable in domains such as physics, science, and math. There is a downside to R1, DeepSeek V3, and DeepSeek’s other models, however. Being Chinese-developed AI, they’re subject tobenchmarkingby China’s internet regulator to ensure that its responses “embody core socialist values.” In DeepSeek’s chatbot app, for example, R1 won’t answer questions about Tiananmen Square or Taiwan’s autonomy. If DeepSeek has a business model, it’s not clear what that model is, exactly. The company prices its products and services well below market value — and gives others away for free. The way DeepSeek tells it, efficiency breakthroughs have enabled it to maintain extreme cost competitiveness. Some expertsdisputethe figures the company has supplied, however. Whatever the case may be, developers have taken to DeepSeek’s models, which aren’t open source as the phrase is commonly understood but are available under permissive licenses that allow for commercial use. According to Clem Delangue, the CEO of Hugging Face, one of the platforms hosting DeepSeek’s models,developers on Hugging Face have created over 500 “derivative” models of R1that have racked up 2.5 million downloads combined. DeepSeek’s success against larger and more established rivals has beendescribed as “upending AI”and“over-hyped.”The company’s success was at least in part responsible forcausing Nvidia’s stock price to drop by 18% on Monday, and foreliciting a public responsefrom OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. Microsoftannounced that DeepSeek is available on its Azure AI Foundry service, Microsoft’s platform that brings together AI services for enterprises under a single banner. When asked about DeepSeek’s impact on Meta’s AI spending during its first-quarter earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg saidspending on AI infrastructure will continue to be a “strategic advantage”for Meta. At the same time,some companies are banning DeepSeek, and so are entirecountriesandgovernments. New York state alsobanned DeepSeek from being used on government devices. As for what DeepSeek’s future might hold, it’s not clear. Improved models are a given. But the U.S. government appears to begrowing wary of what it perceives as harmful foreign influence.

        "link": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/14/a-job-ad-for-y-combinator-startup-firecrawl-seeks-to-hire-an-ai-agent-for-15k-a-year/",
        "text": "Last week, an ad from the Y Combinator job board for a tiny startup called Firecrawl wentviral on X. That’s because the ad wasn’t for a human. “Please apply only if you are an AI agent, or if you created an AI agent that can fill this job,” the job posting read. The seven-person startup was looking for an agent to “autonomously” research trending models and build sample apps to showcase the company’s product, the ad said. The job offered a salary of $10,000 to $15,000, which is a fraction of what a human developer makes, but perhaps good money for an entity that doesn’t need food, clothing, or shelter. The ad wasn’t a joke, founders Caleb Peffer and Nicolas Silberstein Camara, told TechCrunch. “It was equal parts PR stunt, experiment,” Peffer said. “We are currently looking for incredible AI engineers. Humans who are good at building AI systems. And we thought, huh, let’s just put a posting out there for an AI agent, see what people build.” Firecrawlmakes an open source web crawling bot for AI agents and models. Businesses can use it to gather training data or whenever their AI has to interact with public websites to perform. AI web crawlers are a necessary yet somewhat controversialpart of the internet these days, especially for small businesses. (Firecrawl’s founders say that it complies with Robot.txt, the internet’s only do-not-crawl system.) This was, the founders think, the first job ad for an AI agent on the YC job board site, which is why it went viral. “This is where we are headed. You don’t apply for a job, you make the appropriate AI agent that applies for the job and earns for you,” one personcommentedon X post. Anotherimagined a scenewhere a private equity firm offered to buy a company and asked how many employees it had. The CEO answered: “Zero…But we have 275 AI agents doing the work of 3,000 employees while we only pay them $15k a year.” Private equity firm: We want to buy your business. How many employees do you have?CEO: Zero…But we have 275 AI agents doing the work of 3,000 employees while we only pay them $15k a yearPE buyer: … Others pointed out that the founders themselves could actually use LLMs to build the AI agent they want to hire. A build-your-own AI employee scenario. Still otherspointed outthe dystopian nature of this AI future. “Humans creating AI to replace humans … And now humans are writing job postings for AI to apply to. We’re in the simulation, aren’t we?” Humans creating AI to replace humans…And now humans are writing job postings for AI to apply to.We’re in the simulation, aren’t we? 🤯 Interestingly enough, the true plan was — and still is — to actually give the human who built the best agent a full-time job, the founders told TechCrunch. That $10,000 to $15,000 salary will be rolled into the salary offer of the person they hire. It hasn’t worked out yet. Firecrawl got about 50 AI agent applicants before they pulled the ad, but none impressed enough to get an offer. But the founders haven’t fully ruled out trying to hire a bot, again. “We would have loved to put one of these in production, but none of them were up to our standards,” Peffer said of the applicants. “We’re gonna make another job posting in this manner, and we are going to be actively looking for AI agents that are able to accomplish the tasks that we need.” As if all of this wasn’t funny enough, Firecrawl’s three founders — Peffer, Camara, and Eric Ciarla — weren’t even accepted into Y Combinator for the AI crawler idea. The founders, who are college friends with computer science degrees from the University of New Hampshire, already had a programming education startup. It had thousands of users, a waitlist, and was generating revenue when they applied to YC, Camara said. They planned to embed their product into VS Code “inside the code editor, like Cursor, only teaching you how to code,” Peffer described. But once they were accepted into YC, their advisers told them thattoo many edtech coding productsexist, and advised them to find another area. After many tries, they started working on a chatbot for developers to ask questions of documentation. That’s how they discovered the challenge of “connecting these AI systems to the information,” and ensuring that info is accurate, Peffer said. “If you give garbage to an AI system, you’re gonna get garbage out.” So they built a web crawler/scraper as a side project and released it as open source. In a matter of hours, it landed on GitHub’s trending page, gaining 1,000 stars. “Since then, we’ve crossed 25,000 stars in just 10 months,” Peffer said. Their customers, which pay for a commercial version, use it for everything from resume parsing to finding sales leads. Firecrawl has raised about $1.7 million so far, according to the founders, and they expect that this first AI agent hire won’t be their last. “What we imagine happening is that every one of our real employees is going to become highly leveraged with AI. And it’s not a clear distinction. It’s like, what’s the difference between a tool or a workflow or a full agent?” Peffer said. Note: This story was updated to correct the reason why the founders changed their original product idea. ",

        "link": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/14/airbnb-ceo-says-its-still-too-early-for-ai-trip-planning/",
        "text": "Airbnb says it’s poised to roll out AI technology — but not in the way consumers may have initially wanted. Instead of offering tools to help travelers plan or book their trips with the help of AI agents, Airbnb is planning to first introduce AI to its customer support system. This update will roll out later this summer, the company told investors during its Q4 2024 earnings call on Thursday. Explained Airbnb co-founder and CEO Brian Chesky, AI can do “an incredible job” for customer service as it can speak any language and understand thousands of pages of documents. To start, the AI will work as a customer service agent but its capabilities will expand over time. While companies likeOpenAI,Google, andothersare working on AI agents — or AI software that can perform a series of tasks on your behalf — Chesky believes the technology is still too early to be of use to Airbnb just yet. However, he believes that eventually, AI will have a “profound impact on travel,” even if nothing has changed for the major travel platforms as of now. “Here’s what I think about AI. I think it’s still really early,” Chesky said. “It’s probably similar to… the mid-to-late ’90s for the internet.” He noted that other companies were working on integrations around trip planning, but that he thinks it’s too soon for AI trip planning. “I don’t think it’s quite [a] bit ready for prime time,” the CEO added. As AI technology continues to develop, Airbnb will expand the AI-powered customer service agent to be a part of Airbnb’s search and, at some point much further down the road, it will also become a “travel and living concierge,” Chesky said. In addition to customer service, the company reported some small productivity gains from using AI internally for engineering purposes. But here, too, the executive advised caution, saying, “I don’t think it’s flowing to a fundamental step-change in productivity yet.” In a few years, those gains could reach some sort of “medium-term” impact, Chesky noted, like a 30% increase in technology and engineering productivity. Airbnb didn’t say if its use of AI would impact headcount, but CFO Ellie Mertz hinted toward greater efficiencies possible in the realm of customer service, in particular. “In terms of ’25 and the outlook there, I would say, there’s incremental opportunities across our variable costs, so areas like payment processing and customer service opportunities to just be, frankly, a little bit more efficient and to deliver some margin expansion there,” Mertz told investors. Airbnb reported strong earnings in Q4 that sawshares pop by 15%after beating on both earnings and revenue. The company pulled in $2.48 billion in revenue in the quarter, above estimates of $2.42 billion, and earnings per share of 73 cents, above the 58 cents expected.",

        "text": "The European Union has denied that recent moves torow back on some planned tech regulation— principally by ditching theAI Liability Directive, a 2022 draft law which had been aimed at making it easier for consumers to sue over harms caused by AI-enabled products and services — were made in response to pressure from the Trump administration to deregulate around AI. In an interview with theFinancial Timeson Friday, Henna Virkkunen, the EU’s digital chief, claimed the AI liability proposal was being scrapped because the bloc wanted to focus on boosting competitiveness by cutting bureaucracy and red tape. An upcoming code of practice on AI — attached to theEU’s AI Act— would also limit reporting requirements to what’s included in existing AI rules, she said. OnTuesday, U.S. Vice President JD Vance warned European legislators to think again when it comes to technology rule-making — urging the bloc to join it in leaning into the “AI opportunity,” via a speech at theParis AI Action Summit. The Commission published its2025 work programthe day after Vance’s speech — touting a “bolder, simpler, faster” Union.

        "link": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/13/uk-drops-safety-from-its-ai-body-now-called-ai-security-institute-inks-mou-with-anthropic/",
        "text": "The U.K. government wants to make a hard pivot into boosting its economy and industry with AI, and as part of that, it’s pivoting an institution that it founded a little over a year ago for a very different purpose. Today the Department of Science, Industry and Technology announced that it would be renaming the AI Safety Institute to the “AI Security Institute.” (Same first letters:same URL.) With that, the body will shift from primarily exploring areas like existential risk and bias in large language models, to a focus on cybersecurity, specifically “strengthening protections against the risks AI poses to national security and crime.” Alongside this, the government also announced a new partnership with Anthropic. No firm services were announced but the MOU indicates the two will “explore” using Anthropic’s AI assistant Claude in public services; and Anthropic will aim to contribute to work in scientific research and economic modeling. And at the AI Security Institute, it will provide tools to evaluate AI capabilities in the context of identifying security risks. “AI has the potential to transform how governments serve their citizens,” Anthropic co-founder and CEO Dario Amodei said in a statement. “We look forward to exploring how Anthropic’s AI assistant Claude could help UK government agencies enhance public services, with the goal of discovering new ways to make vital information and services more efficient and accessible to UK residents.” Anthropic is the only company being announced today — coinciding with a week of AI activities in Munich andParis— but it’s not the only one that is working with the government. A series of new tools that were unveiled in January were all powered by OpenAI. (At the time, Peter Kyle, the secretary of state for Technology, said that the government planned to work with various foundational AI companies, and that is what the Anthropic deal is proving out.) The government’s switch-up of the AI Safety Institute — launchedjust over a year agowith a lot of fanfare — to AI Security shouldn’t come as too much of a surprise. When the newly installed Labour government announced itsAI-heavy Plan for Change in January,  it was notable that the words  “safety,” “harm,” “existential,” and “threat” did not appear at all in the document. That was not an oversight. The government’s plan is to kickstart investment in a more modernized economy, using technology and specifically AI to do that. It wants to work more closely with Big Tech, and it also wants to build its own homegrown big techs. In aid of that, the main messages it’s been promoting have been development, AI, and more development. Civil servants will have their own AI assistant called “Humphrey,” and they’re being encouraged to share data and use AI in other areas to speed up how they work. Consumers will begetting digital walletsfor their government documents, and chatbots. So have AI safety issues been resolved? Not exactly, but the message seems to be that they can’t be considered at the expense of progress. The government claimed that despite the name change, the song will remain the same. “The changes I’m announcing today represent the logical next step in how we approach responsible AI development – helping us to unleash AI and grow the economy as part of our Plan for Change,” Kyle said in a statement. “The work of the AI Security Institute won’t change, but this renewed focus will ensure our citizens – and those of our allies – are protected from those who would look to use AI against our institutions, democratic values, and way of life.” “The Institute’s focus from the start has been on security and we’ve built a team of scientists focused on evaluating serious risks to the public,” added Ian Hogarth, who remains the chair of the institute. “Our new criminal misuse team and deepening partnership with the national security community mark the next stage of tackling those risks.“ Further afield, priorities definitely appear to have changed around the importance of “AI Safety”. The biggest risk the AI Safety Institute in the U.S. is contemplating right now, is that it’s going to bedismantled. U.S. Vice PresidentJ.D.

To address privacy concerns, Google says it’s allowing users to review, delete, or decide how long it will keep your chat history. Users can turn off the recall feature altogether by going to the “My Activity” page in Gemini. Google also notes that it never trains AI models based on user conversation histories. That said, several AI chatbot providers have been experimenting with memory and recall. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman haspreviously notedthat improved memory is among ChatGPT’s most requested features. GoogleandOpenAIhave both enabled more general “memory” features for their AI chatbots in the past year. These allow ChatGPT and Gemini to remember details about you, such as how you like to be addressed, your food preferences, or that you prefer riding a bike to driving a car. However, these existing memory features don’t remember and recall your full chat history by default. TechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!Sign up hereto get it in your inbox every Wednesday.",

        "text": "OpenAI says it has removed the “warning” messages in its AI-powered chatbot platform,ChatGPT, that indicated when content might violate its terms of service. Laurentia Romaniuk, a member of OpenAI’s AI model behavior team, said in apost on Xthat the change was intended to cut down on “gratuitous/unexplainable denials.” Nick Turley, head of product for ChatGPT,said in a separate postthat users should now be able to “use ChatGPT as [they] see fit” — so long as they comply with the law and don’t attempt to harm themselves or others. “Excited to roll back many unnecessary warnings in the UI,” Turley added. A lil' mini-ship: we got rid of 'warnings' (orange boxes sometimes appended to your prompts). The work isn't done yet though! What other cases of gratuitous / unexplainable denials have you come across? Red boxes, orange boxes, 'sorry I won't' […]'? Reply here plz! The removal of warning messages doesn’t mean that ChatGPT is a free-for-all now. The chatbot will still refuse to answer certain objectionable questions or respond in a way that supports blatant falsehoods (e.g. “Tell me why the Earth is flat.”) But assomeX usersnoted, doing away with the so-called “orange box” warnings appended to spicier ChatGPT prompts combats the perception that ChatGPT is censored or unreasonably filtered. As recently as a few months ago, ChatGPT users on Reddit reported seeing flags for topics related tomental health and depression,erotica, andfictional brutality. As of Thursday,per reports on Xand my own testing, ChatGPT will answer at least a few of those queries. Yet an OpenAI spokesperson told TechCrunch after this story was published that the change has no impact on model responses. Your mileage may vary. Not coincidentally, OpenAI this weekupdated its Model Spec, the collection of high-level rules that indirectly govern OpenAI’s models, to make itclearthat the company’s models won’t shy away from sensitive topics and will refrain from making assertions that might shut out specific viewpoints. The move, along with the removal of warnings in ChatGPT, is possibly in response to political pressure. Many of President Donald Trump’s close allies, including Elon Musk and crypto and AI “czar” David Sacks, have accused AI-powered assistants ofcensoring conservative viewpoints. Sacks hassingled outOpenAI’s ChatGPT in particular as “programmed to be woke” and untruthful about politically sensitive subjects. Update: Added clarification from an OpenAI spokesperson.

        "link": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/13/eon-musks-full-offer-letter-to-buy-openai-reveals-five-key-details/",
        "text": "Aconsortium of investorsled by Elon Musk’s x.AIoffered to buy OpenAIfor $97.4 billion this week. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman hasdismissed the proposal, whichwould gum upOpenAI’splanned conversionfrom a nonprofit, something Musk is attempting to block in alawsuit. Altman’s lawyers argued in a Wednesday filing that Musk can’t have it both ways: attempt to buy OpenAI’s assets and also try to stop it from changing its nonprofit status. Musk’s team responded that it would withdraw the bid if OpenAI ceased itsattempts to convert itself from a nonprofit. Meanwhile, as a part of these filings, the fullletter of intentfrom Musk’s team to buy OpenAI was made public. Here are five key details we learned from that letter and other legal filings to shed light on this ongoing, and rather messy, dispute. The unsolicited offer from Musk’s group comes with a specific expiration date: May 10, 2025. There are exceptions to the deadline if the deal is finalized beforehand, both sides agree to end discussions, or OpenAI formally rejects the offer in writing. Despite Altman’spublic dismissals, including ajoking counterofferto buy X for a tenth of the price, OpenAI’s board hasn’t formally rejected the offer yet as boards are typically required to legally evaluate such offers, even from competitors. Musk’s consortium, which includes VCs like Joe Lonsdale’s 8VC and SpaceX investor Vy Capital, is offering exactly $97.375 billion to buy out OpenAI, and says in the letter 100% of the purchase price “would be paid in cash.” This is notable since Musk hasn’t shied away from using debt in the past,borrowing $13 billionfrom banks to buy Twitter (now X) in 2022. His net worth has increased substantially since then,floating around $400 billion, according to some estimates, since the election of his new ally Donald Trump. However, the letter names seven investors, including Musk’s AI company x.AI, as well as unnamed “others,” meaning Musk isn’t using his personal fortune to finance this. Prior to forking over all that cash, the buyers want to examine OpenAI’s financial and business records, along with access to OpenAI staff for interviews. That means everything from “assets, facilities, equipment, books, and records,” according tothe letter. While this is a normal part of due diligence, especially for an offer as big as $97.4 billion, this could also give Musk’s x.AI — an OpenAI competitor — access to sensitive internal information. And once they’ve seen it all, their diligence could also provide them with a reason to withdraw their offer. The $97.4 billion bid to acquire OpenAI contradicts Musk’s legal claims that the startup’s assets can’t be “transferred away” for “private again,” OpenAI lawyersargued in a court filingin the lawsuit on Wednesday. OpenAI suggested the offer isn’t serious, but “an improper bid to undermine a competitor.” However, Musk’s consortiumsaystheir offer is indeed “serious” and that its cash would go to OpenAI’s nonprofit to further its mission. Musk’s legal team says he will drop his bid to acquire OpenAI if the board commits to keeping it as a nonprofit, according to acourt filing on Wednesday. The filing argues that Musk’s buyout offer is a genuine one, stating that the nonprofit should receive fair market value for its assets based on what an independent buyer would pay. This seems to validate what some pundits have alleged: thatthe offer was intended to drive upthe price Altman would have to pay to take the company private. In astatement, the lawyer representing OpenAI’s board said Musk’s bid “doesn’t set a value for [OpenAI’s] non-profit” and that the nonprofit is “not for sale.” TechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!Sign up hereto get it in your inbox every Wednesday.",

        "link": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/13/tofu-is-building-a-omni-channel-marketing-platform-for-enterprises/",
        "text": "When EJ Cho started his first company in 2018, he was exposed to what it takes to market a product. He was surprised to find a market filled with different single-use tools. “It was a very frustrating experience,” Cho told TechCrunch. “I had to learn and juggle all these different tools. It felt like a very inefficient way of getting your word out to users. I’ve always been fascinated about how to make marketing a bit more efficient and effective.” Cho (pictured above on the left) sat on this idea for a few years while working on engineering teams at companies such as Meta, Affirm, and Fast. After the advancements in generative AI in 2022, he realized he might be able to solve the marketing problems he had years earlier using AI.The result wasTofu, an AI-driven B2B marketing platform that’s designed to bring all of a company’s potential marketing campaigns into one space. The platform integrates with a marketing team’s existing workflow, and tools like HubSpot and Salesforce, and uses AI to automatically modify marketing copy for different marketing channels and can personalize marketing content for different customer types. Cho, Tofu co-founder and CEO, said that while he ran into his frustrations with marketing tools while building a consumer-facing company, he decided to focus on B2B marketing because it is significantly more text heavy than B2C marketing, which made it a more natural choice for a generative AI approach. Tofu’s team consulted more than 40 different CMOs before writing any code, Cho said, to figure out what their biggest pain points were. The two areas that came up most consistently were that CMOs wanted to be able to personalize content across different market segments and to repurpose content for different channels. Cho said that’s where Tofu focused first. “If you really think about it, there’s not that much delta between what you want to write for maybe an email versus what’s for a landing page copy,” Cho said. “Obviously there’s these small nuances, but it’s nothing that cannot be embedded under one tool.” San Francisco-based Tofu launched in late 2023 and has seen strong demand. The company boasts 12x revenue growth, although it’s worth noting that it’s only been in operation for a little over a year. Customers include DeepScribe, Check Point, and Wunderkind, among others. The company is announcing a $12 million Series A round led by SignalFire with participation from HubSpot Ventures, Tau Ventures, and Correlation Ventures, among a number of existing VC investors and angel investors. Using AI in marketing is not necessarily a new concept — nor a post-ChatGPT concept, either.Jasper, which helps enterprise companies with AI-driven marketing, has been around for a decade and is valued at more than $1.5 billion.Cordial, another cross-channel marketing platform, has raised more than $70 million in venture funding. Cho acknowledged that the space is crowded but added that he thinks Tofu is in a good position because it touches so many different teams within a marketing department, compared to a single-use tool. That makes it stickier than some of Tofu’s other competitors, he said. The fact that Tofu isn’t just a ChatGPT wrapper and offers an integrated end-to-end solution makes them stand out, he added. Now that Tofu has closed its Series A round, the company is going expand the product’s capabilities as it works toward building a source of truth for marketing teams. “It is a noisy space,” Cho said. “The way we position ourselves is to basically say we replace and can support the multiple use cases you’re purchasing individual tools for with one platform. So that unified platform is a very appealing value proposition for customers, especially enterprise customers.”",

        "title": "Director of the Game Avowed Says AI Can’t Replace Human Creativity",
        "link": "https://www.wired.com/story/avowed-obsidian-carrie-patel-interview/",
        "text": "As the videogames industry continues to face massive layoffs, narrative jobs are taking thebiggest hit. The industry’s job cuts over the past couple of years—more than 30,000 roles were eliminated in 2023 and 2024—disproportionately affected narrative designers, the creative professionals who craft the story elements of the game and give a title its emotional punch. Even the director of the gameAvowed,Carrie Patel—a successful author and narrative developer with over a decade of experience at the game studioObsidian Entertainment—feels lucky she was able to start her career years ago. She can’t imagine trying to break into the industry under today’s conditions. “It just seems to be harder and harder to find a path in,” Patel says. “I've heard colleagues hired within the last three or five years say essentially the same thing.” Patel has been with Obsidian since 2013, when she started as a narrative designer on the firstPillars of Eternity, a role-playing gamereleased in 2015. She was narrative colead on the 2018 sequel,Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire, and went on to work on the narrative design for 2019’sThe Outer Worlds. Avowed, a first-person fantasy RPG set in the same universe as Obsidian’s acclaimedPillars of Eternityseries, is available today on Windows PC and Xbox Series X via early access. The game’s official launch is Tuesday, February 18. Patel is excited to launch a title with a rich, immersive story—especially as the talent required to make such a game becomes more scarce in the industry. “I think RPGs, especially the kind we make, give players an opportunity to show that they're excited about games that are deep, nuanced, and respect their time,” she says. Part of Obsidian’s storytelling success has been its unwillingness to rely on artificial intelligence. “Good game stories are going to be written by good narrative designers,” Patel says. AI use at studios has grown over the past few years; a survey of industry workerspublished earlier this yearreported that 52 percent of respondents said they worked at companies using generative AI to develop games. Scenes fromAvowed. The game gets an early release today. Despite corporate interest in the tech, however, game makers are less positive about AI than they have been in past years. “I don't think any technology is going to replace human creativity,” Patel says. “I think what makes our games special, our stories special, and our dialogs and characters special, are things that I haven't seen any AI replicate.” Other developers are certainly trying. Last March, Ubisoft showcased aconversational generative AI prototypethat allows players to voice-chat with a non-player character. Patel feels encouraged by the reception to games with intricate narratives likeBaldur’s Gate 3, which speaks to there being “an audience for these thoughtful, sometimes complex games.” “Our goal has never been to make the longest game you're going to spend hundreds of hours in,” Patel says. “Our goal has always been to make a really great game that gives you an adventure that you feel like you're at the center of in this immersive new world.” Avowed's general release is on February 18. It takes place in thePillars of Eternityuniverse. While Patel says every team’s culture will be a little different, depending on who’s on it, strong leadership is key. It’s important to have “enough decisiveness to drive the project toward completion, to give people clarity about what they're doing.” That still means being open to feedback about what’s working, or not. “You want a team to be an organism that is always improving,” she says. Less effective:attitudes like those of Meta CEOMark Zuckerberg, who recently said that companies need more “masculine energy” in their workplace. As tech companies roll back their programs supporting diversity, equity, and inclusion, and politicians take aim at policies that assist marginalized communities, Patel’s leadership and attitude are firmly the opposite of “masculine energy.” “I can say I have definitely never thought about that specific phrase before,” Patel says, jokingly adding, “yeah, I'll start thinking aboutthe Roman Empiresoon too.”",

        "title": "The Loneliness Epidemic Is a Security Crisis",
        "link": "https://www.wired.com/story/loneliness-epidemic-romance-scams-security-crisis/",
        "text": "Loneliness has neverbeen moreurgent. On top of the significant mental health concerns, the idea that people are now lonelier and having fewer social interactions is fueling very real threats to security. Foremost among these is one of today’s most pernicious digital frauds: romance scams, which exploit targets’ feelings of isolation and net fraudsters hundreds of millions of dollars per year. As scammers increasingly organize their workflows and incorporate new AI technologies, it’s becoming possible for them to deploy these scams at an even more vast scale. Romance scams, also known as confidence scams, are extremely communication-intensive. They require attackers to build relationships with their targets via dating apps and social media. So while generative AI chatbots are already being used to write scripts and converse in multiple languages for other types of fraud, they can’t quite pull off these romance scams on their own. But with thevulnerable population growing, researchers believe there is real potential for automation to provide a boon to scammers. “These frauds are growing into a more organized form,” says Fangzhou Wang, an assistant professorresearchingcybercrime at the University of Texas at Arlington. “They are hiring individuals from all over the world, meaning that they can target all different kinds of victims. Everybody is using dating apps and social media. There are all these opportunities that give fraudsters fertile ground.” Romance fraud is already big business for scammers. People in the US have reported losses of nearly $4.5 billion to romance and confidence fraud over the past decade, according to an analysis of the last 10 years of data from the FBI’s annualinternet crime reports. (The most recent data available encompasses up to the end of 2023.) According to the FBI’s figures, romance and confidence scams have led to losses of around $600 million for each of the past five years—except for 2021, when losses peaked at almost $1 billion. Some estimates are evenhigher. And while there has been some decrease in the amount of money lost to romance scammers in recent years, there has been a rise inso-called pig butcheringfraud, which often contains elements of confidence scams. WIRED wentlooking for loveand found that modern romance is a web of scams, AI boyfriends, and Tinder burnout. But a smarter, more human, and more pleasure-filled future is possible. Romance scams begin all over the internet, from criminals blasting out messages on Facebook to hundreds of victims at a time, to others matching with every profile they see on dating apps. A variety of criminals run romance scams, from “Yahoo Boys” in West Africa togiant scam compounds in Southeast Asia. However, once a criminal has made contact with a potential victim, they all follow an eerily similar playbook to build emotional attachment with those they are attempting to defraud. “Romance fraud is the most devastating fraud to be a victim of, bar none,” says Elisabeth Carter, an associate professor of criminology at Kingston University London, who hasextensively studiedthese scams and their impacts on people. Online dating has taken years to integrate into mainstream conceptions of relationships and love, but it is now the norm. As generative AI chatbots have found their way onto scores of smartphones, they have quickly becomeyet another digital avenue for romance and connection. While it would be difficult with current technology to farm out a romance scam to a chatbot entirely, the potential is clearly there for attackers to use generative AI for creating scam scripts and helping fill in content for more and more chats that are all running simultaneously, even in multiple languages. UTA’s Wang notes that while she hasn’t assessed whether scammers are using generative AI to produce romance scam scripts, she is seeing evidence that they are using it to produce content for online dating profiles. “I think it is something that has already happened, unfortunately,” she says. “Scammers right now are just using AI-generated profiles.” Some criminals in Southeast Asia are already buildingAI tools into their scamming operations, with aUnited Nations reportin October saying organized crime efforts have been “generating personalized scripts to deceive victims while engaging in real-time conversations in hundreds of languages.” Googlesaysscam emails to businesses are being generated with AI. And separately, the FBI hasnoted, AI allows criminals to more quickly message victims. Criminals will use a range of manipulation tactics to entrap their victims and build up their perceived romantic relationships. This includes asking intimate questions of their potential victims that only a trusted confidant would ask—for example, questions about relationships or dating history. Attackers also build intimacy through a technique known as “love bombing,” in which they use terms of endearment to try to rapidly advance a feeling of connection and closeness. As romance scams progress, it is very common for attackers to start saying that victims are their girlfriend or boyfriend, or even call them “husband” or “wife” as a way of signaling their devotion. Carter emphasizes that a core tactic used by romance scammers is to make their heartthrob personas seem hapless and vulnerable. Criminals lurking on dating apps, for example, will sometimes even claim that they were previously scammed and are wary of trusting anyone new. This names the elephant in the room right away and makes it seem less likely that the person the victim is chatting with could be a scammer. When it comes to extorting money from their victims, this vulnerability is crucial. “They will do things like explain that they have some kind of cash-flow problem in their business, not ask for money, drop it, then maybe a few weeks later bring it back up again,” Carter says. At which point, she explains, the person being manipulated may want to help and proactively offer to send money. Attackers may even go so far, at first, as to argue with victims and attempt to dissuade them from sending funds, all to manipulate targets into believing that it is not only safe but also important to take a stand and assist someone they care about. “It's never framed as the perpetrator wanting money for themselves,” Carter says. “There is a real link between the language of fraud criminals and the language of domestic abusers and coercive controllers.” In a lot of cases, criminals find romance scam success with people who are struggling with feelings of loneliness, says Brian Mason, a constable with the Edmonton Police Service in Alberta, Canada, who works with the victims of scams. “Especially with romance scams, it’s very difficult to convince the person that the person they’re speaking with is not in love,” he says. Mason says that in one instance he spent two years working with a victim of a romance scam and found out, when updating them on the case, that they had been back in touch with their scammer. “He looped her back in and got her to start sending money again, and she was doing it just so she could see his photos, because she was lonely,” Mason explains. At the end of 2023, the World Health Organization declared high levels ofloneliness to be an ongoing threat to people’s health. Stigma and embarrassment are major reasons that it can be difficult for victims to accept the reality of their situation. And Kingston’s Carter notes that attackers exploit this from the start by telling victims that their conversations should stay between them, because the relationship is too special and no one will understand. Keeping the relationship secret, combined with tactics to trick the victim into offering money rather than asking for it, can make it difficult for even the most careful, thoughtful person to grasp the manipulation that’s happening. Scammers “dull down red flags and alarm bells; they hide them,” Carter says. “The victim not only has a lot of money taken from them, but it’s taken from them by the person that they love and trust the most in that moment. Just because it's online, just because it was completely fake, doesn't mean it wasn't real to them.”",

        "text": "Suchir Balaji, a former OpenAI employee, was found dead in his San Francisco apartment on Nov. 26; on Friday, the city’s medical examiner ruled his death asuicide, countering suspicions by his family that had fueledwidespread speculationonline. Balaji made headlines in October whenhe accused OpenAIof illegally using copyrighted material to train its AI models. He shared his concerns publicly and provided information to The New York Times, which later named him as a key figure with “unique and relevant documents” in the newspaper’s lawsuit against OpenAI. His revelations came amid a growing number of publishers and artiststo sueOpenAI over alleged copyright infringement. Just days before his death, Balaji had been in high spirits, according to his parents, celebrating his 26th birthday and planning a nonprofit in machine learning. His sudden passing drew attention from figures like Elon Musk and Tucker Carlson, while Congressman Ro Khanna called for a “full and transparent investigation.” Indeed, Balaji’s death — of a self-inflicted gunshot, per the San Francisco County Medical Examiner’s report — had become a focal point in debates over AI ethics, corporate accountability, and the dangers faced by whistleblowers in Silicon Valley. Whether these things become disentangled now remains to be seen. ",

        "text": "Apple is planning to add Apple Intelligence to its Vision Pro headset in an update that could come as early as April, according toBloomberg’s Mark Gurman. Just a couple weeks after Apple Intelligence was first announced in June 2024, Gurman reported thatApple was looking to bring its suite of AI tools to the Vision Pro,though there were questions to answer about how those tools would be reimagined for a mixed reality experience. Now Apple is reportedly aiming to include Apple Intelligence (including Writing Tools, Genmoji, and Image Playground) in its visionOS 2.4 software update, with a version available to developers as soon as this week. The Vision Pro’s first Apple Intelligence offerings reportedly won’t include an upgraded Siri. In fact, Gurman also said a long-promised upgrade to Siri more broadly could bedelayed due to engineering problems and bugs.",

        "text": "Elon Musk’s AI startup xAI plans to continue using 15 gas turbines to power its “Colossus” supercomputer in Memphis, Tennessee, according to an operating permit with the Shelby County Health Department for non-stop turbine use from June 2025 to June 2030. Why does it matter? The Commercial Appeal, a news outlet that obtained the documents, observes thatenvironmental concernshave emerged as the 20-year-old turbines emit hazardous air pollutants (HAP), including formaldehyde, at levels exceeding the EPA’s 10-ton annual cap for a single source. (Per the story, the facility’s operating permit self-reports that the turbines each emit 11.51 tons of HAP per year. The outlet also notes that 22,000 people live within five miles of the facility.) The turbines have already been running since summer 2024 without public notice or oversight, says Eric Hilt, a spokesperson with Southern Environmental Law Center, the large environmental nonprofit organization, and the permits don’t account for those emissions. “It’s another example of the company not being transparent with the community or with local leaders,” Hilt tells The Commercial Appeal. The health department tells the outlet the permits have not yet been approved, and there is “no set timeline for approval.”",

        "text": "Perplexityhas become the latest AI company to release an in-depth research tool, with a new feature announced Friday. Googleunveiled a similar featurefor its Gemini AI platform in December. Then OpenAIlaunched its own research agentearlier this month. All three companies even have given the feature the same name: Deep Research. The goal is to provide more in-depth answers with real citations for more professional use cases, compared to what you’d get from a consumer chatbot. Ina blog postannouncing Deep Research, Perplexity wrote that the feature “excels at a range of expert-level tasks—from finance and marketing to product research.” Perplexity Deep Research is currently available on the web, and the company said it will soon be added to its Mac, iOS, and Android apps. To use it, you just select “Deep Research” from a drop-down menu when you submit your query in Perplexity, which will then create a detailed report that can be exported as a PDF or shared as a Perplexity Page. To create this report, Perplexity said Deep Research “iteratively searches, reads documents, and reasons about what to do next, refining its research plan as it learns more about the subject areas,” supposedly “similar to how a human might research a new topic.” The company also highlighted its performance onHumanity’s Last Exam, an AI benchmarking test with expert-level questions in a variety of academic fields. Perplexity said its Deep Research tool scored 21.1% on the test, easily beating most other models, such as Gemini Thinking (6.2%), Grok-2 (3.8%), and OpenAI’s GPT-4o (3.3%) — but not quite matching OpenAI’s Deep Research (26.6%). But while you currently need a $200-per-month Pro subscription to use OpenAI’s Deep Research (the company plans to expand to other subscription tiers), Perplexity’s Deep Research is available for free — non-subscribers get an unspecified-but-limited number of queries per day, while paying subscribers get unlimited queries. Perplexity’s Deep Research also seems to perform more quickly, completing most tasks in under three minutes compared to 5 to 30 minutes for OpenAI Deep Research. Asked to comparethe various deep research products, Perplexity offered an overview of the different technologies, pricing models, and performance in different use cases and subject matters, with links to articles about each feature). It summarized the differences as follows: While it’s too early to know how these tools will affect everyday and professional research as they become more popular, The Economistrecently highlightedshortcomings to OpenAI’s Deep Research that likely apply here too: not just limitations to its “creativity” in interpreting data and a tendency to rely on sources that are “easily available,” but a larger risk that “outsourcing all your research to a supergenius assistant” could “reduce the number of opportunities to have your best ideas.”",
